Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasmer.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For those who
don&#x27;t know this name, it has a twofold meaning: it&#x27;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;very popular
WebAssembly runtime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as well as a
startup. I want to write about what I&#x27;ve been able to accomplish during
my time at Wasmer (a high overview, not a technical view), and what
&lt;em&gt;forces&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; me to leave the company despite being one of its co-founder. I
reckon my testimony can help other people to avoid digging into the hell
I (and my colleagues) had to endure. I&#x27;m available for work, you can
contact me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ivan@mnt.io&quot;&gt;ivan@mnt.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnt_io&quot;&gt;@mnt_io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;ivan-enderlin&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ivan-enderlin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (LinkedIn).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-nothing-to-pure-awesomeness&quot;&gt;From nothing to pure awesomeness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve joined the Wasmer company at its early beginning, in March 2019.
The company was 3 months old. My initial role was to write and to
improve the runtime itself, and to create many embeddings, i.e. ways to
integrate the Wasmer runtime inside various technologies, so that
WebAssembly can run everywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say with confidence that my work is a success. I&#x27;ve learned a lot,
and I&#x27;ve worked on so many different projects, technologies, hacked so
many things, collaborated with so many people, every action was led by
the &lt;strong&gt;passion&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, Wasmer has an incredible growth. In 2.5 years
only, the runtime has more than 10&#x27;500 stars on Github, and is &lt;strong&gt;one of
the most popular WebAssembly runtime in the world&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;! It&#x27;s used by many
various companies, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;confio.tech&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Confio&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluence.network&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Fluence
Labs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hotg.dev&#x2F;&quot;&gt;HOT-G&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Brave&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Google&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacemesh.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;SpaceMesh&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkerd.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Linkerd&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.singlestore.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;SingleStore&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clever-cloud.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CleverCloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;konghq.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kong&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to name a few (for the ones I can name
though, however other companies are also using Wasmer in very critical
environments).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my engineering job happened on the Wasmer runtime itself. At the
time of writing, I&#x27;m the #2 contributor on the project. I was working
on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;f9ff574e10d4ee97f836565bdae99035e04ac879&#x2F;lib&quot;&gt;every parts of the
runtime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:
the API, the C API, the compilers, the ABI (mostly WASI), the engines,
the middlewares, and the VM itself which is the most low-level
foundamental layer of the runtime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The runtime provides so many features. It is an impressively powerful
runtime for WebAssembly, and I&#x27;m saying that with a neutral and
respectful mindset. Not everything is perfect obviously but I did my
best to set up a truly user-friendly learning environment, with an
important documentation and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;f9ff574e10d4ee97f836565bdae99035e04ac879&#x2F;examples&quot;&gt;a collection of
examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
that illustrate many features. I strongly believe it contributed to
Wasmer&#x27;s popularity to great extent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to highlight the most notable embedding projects I&#x27;ve
created:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;c-api&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is
the C embedding for Wasmer. It&#x27;s part of the Wasmer runtime itself, and is
fully written in Rust.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;wasmer-c-api&#x2F;*&#x2F;wasmer_c_api&#x2F;wasm_c_api&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;The documentation, the C
examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
everything is super polished to offer the best experience possible. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MarkMcCaskey&quot;&gt;Mark
McCaskey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and I are the authors of this
project.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-python&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the Python
embedding for Wasmer. At the time of writing, it&#x27;s been installed more than 5
millions times (I&#x27;m counting the compiler packages too, like
&lt;code&gt;wasmer-compiler-cranelift&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and so on), and 1300 stars on Github. There is
about 300&#x27;000 downloads per months, and it continues to grow! The code is
written in Rust, and it relies on
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyo3.rs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the awesome &lt;code&gt;pyo3&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; .&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-go&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-go&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the Go embedding for
Wasmer. It&#x27;s hard to know how much total downloads we have because of how the
Go ecosystem is designed, but we have about 60&#x27;000 downloads per months from
Github (I&#x27;m excluding the forks of the project), and 1600 stars on Github. The
code is written in Go and uses &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;cmd&#x2F;cgo&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cgo&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to bind
against the C API. Almost all blockchain projects that use WebAssembly are
using &lt;code&gt;wasmer-go&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, which is a popularity I wasn&#x27;t expecting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-ruby&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-ruby&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the Ruby
embedding for Wasmer. It&#x27;s not as popular as the others, but it&#x27;s also very
polished and it&#x27;s finding its place in the Ruby ecosystem. The code is written
in Rust, and it relies on
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danielpclark&#x2F;rutie&quot;&gt;the awesome &lt;code&gt;rutie&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; .&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I won&#x27;t detail all the projects, but there is also
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-php&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-java&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-postgres&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-postgres&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;… Because of
the Wasmer runtime API and C API we have designed, many developers around the
globe have been able to create a lot more embeddings, such as in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;migueldeicaza&#x2F;WasmerSharp&quot;&gt;C#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chances&#x2F;wasmer-d&quot;&gt;D&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tessi&#x2F;wasmex&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dirkschumacher&#x2F;wasmr&quot;&gt;R&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AlwaysRightInstitute&#x2F;SwiftyWasmer&quot;&gt;Swift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zigwasm&#x2F;wasmer-zig&quot;&gt;Zig&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dart-lang&#x2F;wasm&quot;&gt;Dart&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;helmutkian&#x2F;cl-wasm-runtime&quot;&gt;Lisp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and so on.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fun notable projects are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;sonde-rs&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sonde-rs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a library to
compile USDT probes into a Rust library,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;llvm-custom-builds&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;llvm-custom-builds&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a
sandbox to produce custom LLVM builds for various platforms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;loupe&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;loupe&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a set of tools to
analyse and to profile Rust code,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;interface-types&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-interface-types&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a
“living” (understand an unstable playground) library that implements
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;interface-types&quot;&gt;the WebAssembly Interface Types proposal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hywan&#x2F;inline-c-rs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;inline-c-rs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, to write and
to execute C code inside Rust,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-memory filesystem, that acts exactly like &lt;code&gt;std::fs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might think, I&#x27;ve learned so much. The impostor syndrom was very
present because I was constantly trying to do something I didn&#x27;t know.
It&#x27;s part of the routine at Wasmer: Trying something for the first time.
But it&#x27;s also what kept me motivated, and it was the energy for my
passion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list above shows released projects, but I&#x27;ve also experimented (and
sometimes at two hairs of a release) with:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unikernel&quot;&gt;Unikernels&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; this one was really
fun, given a WebAssembly module and a filesystem, we were able to generate a
unikernel that was executing the given program,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parser; to write the fastest WebAssembly parser possible, it was working, but
never released,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) ABI for WebAssembly, so that we can run
WebAssembly on small chips super easily (think of IoT),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking; an extension to WASI to support networking (TCP and UDP sockets),
with an implementation in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C_standard_library&quot;&gt;libc&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and even
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zig&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;! We were able to compile C programs to
WebAssembly like cURL, or TCP servers written with kqueue or epoll etc, and to
execute them on any platforms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those things were working.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely crazy what WebAssembly can do today, and I still truly
and deeply believe in this technology. I&#x27;m not the only one:
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;YCombinator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;speedinvest&#x2F;the-next-generation-of-cloud-computing-investing-in-wasmer-768c9aac5922&quot;&gt;SpeedInvest&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
are also founders that believe in Wasmer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. What a dream, huh?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-toxic-working-environment&quot;&gt;The toxic working environment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; without its community. I won&#x27;t name people to
avoid missing important persons, but all the contributors are doing
amazing work, to create something new, something special, something
&lt;em&gt;right&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer is a success. The Wasmer runtime is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; without the
incredible, marvelous, exceptional team of engineers behind it. In no
particular order: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lachlansneff&quot;&gt;Lachlan Sneff&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MarkMcCaskey&quot;&gt;Mark McCaskey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jubianchi&quot;&gt;Julien
Bianchi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nlewycky&quot;&gt;Nick
Lewycky&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;losfair&quot;&gt;Heyang
Zhou&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xmclark&quot;&gt;Mackenzie
Clark&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bjfish&quot;&gt;Brandon
Fish&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. All of them, with no exception, have
put a lot of passion in this project. It is what it is today because of
them and also because of the contributors we have been honored to
welcome. The open source side of Wasmer was intense but also an
important source of joy. It is a respectful place to work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the inside reality was very different. All the employees
hereinabove have left the company. Almost all of them due to a burn-out
or conflicts or strong disagreements with the company leadership. I am
leaving due to a severe burn-out. I would like to briefly share my
journey to my first burn-out in few points:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#x27;ve started as an engineer. I love coding. I love hacking. In Wasmer, I&#x27;ve
found a place to learn a lot and to express my passion. We had a lot of
pressure mostly because our friendly “competitors” had more people dedicated
to work on their runtimes, more money, more power, better marketing and so on.
That&#x27;s the inevitable burden of any startup. When you&#x27;re competing against
giants, that&#x27;s what happens. And that&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s part of the game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During that time, we were delivering more and more projects, more and more
features, at an incredible pace. New hats: Release manager, project manager,
more product ownership, more customers to be connected with, more contributors
to help, more issues to triage, blog writer etc. The pace was accelerating too
fast, something we did notice on multiple occasions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CEO, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;syrusakbary&quot;&gt;Syrus Akbary&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, had evidently a lot
of pressure on its shoulders. It sadly resulted in the worst possible way:
micro-management, stress, pressure, bad leadership, lack of vision, lack of
trust in the employees, changing the roadmap constantly, lies, secrets etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As one of the older in the company, with a family of two kids, I probably got
more “wisdom”. I&#x27;ve decided to create a safe place for employees to express
their frustrations, their needs, to find solutions together. &lt;em&gt;De facto&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, I
became the “person of trust” in the company. I got new hats, new pressures.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 hit. School at home. Lock-down. More micro-management, more stress.
Wasmer was running out of money. I brought a new investor that saved the
company. New hat.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After too many departures (85% of the engineering team!), I tried to take more
space and to take more responsabilities in the company. That was at the
beginning of 2021. It was my last attempt to save the company from a disaster
before leaving. &lt;strong&gt;I couldn&#x27;t imagine leaving such brilliant and successful
projects without having tried everything I could&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then &lt;strong&gt;I became a &lt;em&gt;late co-founder&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Too many new hats: Doing
hiring interviews, accountabilities, helping to define the roadmap (with
another awesome person, friend, and employee), handling legal aspects to hire
people in multiple countries with non-precarious contracts etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, I was also doing the job of all the engineers that have left. They
were not replaced for unknown reasons. It was absolutely madness. The pace was
unsustainable.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the crack. The CEO continued to change the roadmap, to take bad
decisions, to not recognize all the efforts we were doing to save&#x2F;grow the
company. It was my turn to be declared in a &lt;em&gt;severe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; burn-out by my physician.
The last engineer to fall.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point: Syrus Akbary also has made many public errors that have
created hostility against the company. Hopefully people were smart and
kind enough to make the difference between the employees and the CEO (I
won&#x27;t name the people but they will recognize themselves: Thank you). I
tried to fix that situation. Discussing with dozens of person to restore
empathy and forgiveness, to create better collaboration, to cure and
move forward. It was exhausting. I know people have appreciated what I
did, but my mental health was ruined.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all the time I&#x27;ve devoted to the company, the very few
consideration I got in return, the countless work hours (4 days per
week, but frequently closing the computer at 1am due to very late
meetings, I was working like hell), the precarious contract I had (did
you ever see a co-founder with a freelancer contract?), the toxic
working environment, the constant pressure etc., my passion was intact
but my motivation was seriously damaged. Doing overtime was never
recorded and was happening more than frequently, but taking half a day
to take care of a sick child was immediately counted as holidays; the
balance was broken. Criticisms. Micro-management. Disapprovals.
Rewriting the facts and the reality to criticize what you&#x27;re doing,
flipping things against you, avoiding discussion when things get stormy.
We even had a meeting titled “Why you&#x27;re not productive enough” whilst
everyone was working as hell, right after the rewrite of the entire
runtime to release Wasmer 1.0, a period we all affectionately called
“The Rewrite of Hell”. The team deserved vacations, congratulations,
attentions, gratitude, … not such a shitty meeting. Well, you get the
idea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&#x27;ve been declared in a severe burn-out, I had to take a break. The
reaction from the CEO was… unexpected: Zero empathy, asking to never
ever being sick again (otherwise I will be fired), dividing my equities,
asking me to work more, saying I&#x27;ve never been involved in the company
etc. That was the final straw to me. That&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;the&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wrong way to treat an
employee, a collaborator, a contributor, the co-founder.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;What&#x27;s next?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to recover. As you can imagine, working 2.5 years at this pace
leaves sequelae. Hopefully a couple of months should suffice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m still in love with Wasmer, the &lt;strong&gt;runtime&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, the open source projects
we have created. It has a bright future. More companies are contributing
to it, more individual contributors are bringing their stones to the
monument. The project is owned by the public, by the users, by the
contributors, they are doing most of the work today. It&#x27;s well tested,
well documented, it&#x27;s easy to contribute to it. It&#x27;s a fabulous open
source piece of technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Wasmer, the &lt;strong&gt;company&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, will change. The products
that are going to be released are absolutely fantastic. It&#x27;s a
technology shift. It will enable the Decentralized Web, how we compile
and distribute programs, how we will even consume programs. Wasmer has a
solid bright future. I really &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; things will change, and I wish the
best to and am passing on the torch to the adventurers that will
continue to move the company forward. I&#x27;m just too &lt;em&gt;skeptical&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that
things can improve or even slightly change. We have built something
great. Please take a great care of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a portable binary format.
That means the same file can run anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uphold this bold statement, each language, platform and system must
be able to run WebAssembly — as fast and safely as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are familiar with Wasmer are used to this kind of
announcement! Wasmer is written in Rust, and comes with an additional
native C API. But you can use it in a lot of other languages. After
having announced libraries to use Wasmer, and thus WebAssembly, in:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…we are jazzed to announce that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;Wasmer has now landed in
Java&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s discover the Wasmer JNI library together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wasmer JNI (&lt;em&gt;Java Native Interface&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) library is based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer
runtime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is written in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and is compiled to a shared library.
For your convenience, we produce one JAR (&lt;em&gt;Java Archive&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) per
architecture and platform. By now, the following are supported,
consistently tested, and pre-packaged (available in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bintray.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;wasmer-jni&#x2F;wasmer-jni&quot;&gt;Bintray&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;releases&quot;&gt;Github
Releases&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;amd64-darwin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for macOS, x86 64bits,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;amd64-linux&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for Linux, x86 64 bits,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;amd64-windows&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for Windows, x86 64 bits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More architectures and more platforms will be added in the near future.
If you need a specific one, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;issues&#x2F;new?assignees=&amp;amp;labels=%F0%9F%8E%89+enhancement&amp;amp;template=---feature-request.md&amp;amp;title=&quot;&gt;feel free to
ask&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!
However, it is possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm#development&quot;&gt;produce your own JAR for your own platform
and
architecture&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JAR files are named as follows:
&lt;code&gt;wasmer-jni-$(architecture)-$(os)-$(version).jar&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Thus, to include
Wasmer JNI as a dependency of your project (assuming you use
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gradle.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Gradle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), write for instance:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;language-text z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;dependencies {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;    implementation &amp;quot;org.wasmer:wasmer-jni-amd64-linux:0.2.0&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAR are hosted on the Bintray&#x2F;JCenter repository under the
&lt;code&gt;[wasmer-jni](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bintray.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;wasmer-jni&#x2F;wasmer-jni)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
project. They are also attached to our &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;releases&quot;&gt;Github releases as
assets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;calling-a-webassembly-function-from-java&quot;&gt;Calling a WebAssembly function from Java&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, let’s start with a simple Rust program that we will compile to
WebAssembly, and then execute from Java.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;rust&quot; class=&quot;language-rust z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot; data-lang=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;no_mangle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-modifier z-rust&quot;&gt;pub&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-other z-rust&quot;&gt;extern&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;fn&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-entity z-name z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-rust&quot;&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-rust&quot;&gt;y&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-return-type z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-block z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;    x &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-arithmetic z-rust&quot;&gt;+&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; y
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-block z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;}&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After compilation to WebAssembly, we get a file like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;raw&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;simple.wasm&quot;&gt;this
one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
named &lt;code&gt;simple.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Java program executes the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; exported function by
passing &lt;code&gt;5&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;37&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as arguments:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-import z-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-import z-java&quot;&gt;import&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-path z-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-support z-type z-package z-java&quot;&gt;org&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-path z-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-accessor z-dot z-java&quot;&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-support z-type z-package z-java&quot;&gt;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-accessor z-dot z-java&quot;&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-support z-class z-import z-java&quot;&gt;Instance&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-terminator z-java&quot;&gt;;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! We have successfully executed a Rust program, compiled to
WebAssembly, in Java. As you can see, it is pretty straightforward. The
API is very similar to the standard JavaScript API, or the other API we
have designed for PHP, Python, Go, Ruby etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assiduous reader might have noticed the &lt;code&gt;[0]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;.apply(5, 37)[0]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
pattern. A WebAssembly function can return zero to many values, and in
this case, we are reading the first one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Java values passed to WebAssembly exported functions are
automatically downcasted to WebAssembly values. Types are inferred at
runtime, and casting is done automatically. Thus, a WebAssembly
function acts as any regular Java function.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, an exported function is a &lt;em&gt;functional interface&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as defined
by the Java Language Specification (i.e. it is a
&lt;code&gt;[FunctionalInterface](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;8&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;lang&#x2F;FunctionalInterface.html)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;).
Thus, it is possible to write the following code where &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is an
actual function (of kind &lt;code&gt;org.wasmer.exports.Function&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a WebAssembly module not only exports functions, it also exports
memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-the-memory&quot;&gt;Reading the memory&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WebAssembly instance has one or more linear memories, a contiguous and
byte-addressable range of memory spanning from offset 0 and extending up
to a varying memory size, represented by the &lt;code&gt;org.wasmer.Memory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; class.
Let’s see how to use it. Consider the following Rust program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;rust&quot; class=&quot;language-rust z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot; data-lang=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;no_mangle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;return_hello&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function returns a pointer to the statically
allocated string. The string exists in the linear memory of the
WebAssembly module. It is then possible to read it in Java:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the &lt;code&gt;Memory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; API provides a &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method. It returns a
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;8&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;nio&#x2F;ByteBuffer.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;direct&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; byte
buffer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(of kind &lt;code&gt;java.nio.ByteBuffer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) view of the memory. It’s a standard API
for any Java developer. We think it’s best to not reinvent the wheel and
use standard API as much as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WebAssembly memory is dissociated from the JVM memory, and thus from
the garbage collector.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;GreetExample.java&quot;&gt;the Greet

&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-documentation&quot;&gt;More documentation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project comes with a &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;make javadoc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; command will
generate a traditional local Javadoc for you, in the
&lt;code&gt;build&#x2F;docs&#x2F;javadoc&#x2F;index.html&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the project’s &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file has an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm#api-of-the-wasmer-library&quot;&gt;API of
the &lt;code&gt;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; library
Section&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project comes with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&quot;&gt;a set of
examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Use the &lt;code&gt;make run-example EXAMPLE=Simple&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to run the
&lt;code&gt;SimpleExample.java&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; example for instance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly aims at being safe, but also fast. Since Wasmer JNI is the
&lt;em&gt;first&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Java library to execute WebAssembly, we can’t compare to prior
works in the Java ecosystem. However, you might know that Wasmer comes
with 3 backends: Singlepass, Cranelift and LLVM. We’ve even written an
article about it: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;a-webassembly-compiler-tale-9ef37aa3b537&quot;&gt;A WebAssembly Compiler
tale&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The Wasmer JNI library uses the Cranelift backend for the moment, which
offers the best compromise between compilation-time and execution-time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;Credits&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asami (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;d0iasm&quot;&gt;d0iasm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Twitter) has improved
this project during its internship at Wasmer under my guidance. She
finished the internship before the release of the Wasmer JNI project,
but she deserves credits for pushing the project forward! Good work
Asami!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity to remind everyone that we hire anywhere in the
world. Asami was working from Japan while I am working from Switzerland,
and the rest of the team is from US, Spain, China etc. Feel free to
contact me (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnt_io&quot;&gt;@mnt_io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;syrusakbary&quot;&gt;@syrusakbary&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Twitter) if you want
to join us on this big adventure!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer JNI is a library to execute WebAssembly directly in Java. It
embeds the WebAssembly runtime
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The first releases provide
the core API with &lt;code&gt;Module&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Instance&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Memory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. It comes
pre-packaged as a JAR, one per architecture and per platform.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is open and hosted on Github at
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
We are constantly improving the project, so if you have feedback,
issues, or feature requests please open an issue in the repository, or
reach us on Twitter at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;wasmerio&quot;&gt;@wasmerio&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnt_io&quot;&gt;@mnt_io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to see what you build with this!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is a portable binary format. That means the same program can
run anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uphold this bold statement, each language, platform and system must
be able to run WebAssembly — as fast and safely as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say it again. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a
WebAssembly runtime. We have successfully embedded the runtime in other
languages:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Rust, as it is written in Rust&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;runtime-c-api&quot;&gt;C and C++
bindings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In PHP, using

&lt;p&gt;The community has also embedded Wasmer in awesome projects:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.NET&#x2F;C#, using
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;migueldeicaza&#x2F;WasmerSharp&quot;&gt;WasmerSharp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is now time to continue the story and to hang around…
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Postgres&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so happy to announce a newcrazy idea: &lt;strong&gt;WebAssembly on
Postgres&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Yes, you read that correctly. On
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;postgres-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;Postgres&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;calling-a-webassembly-function-from-postgres&quot;&gt;Calling a WebAssembly function from Postgres&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, we have to go through the installation process. There is no
package manager for Postgres, so it’s a manual step. The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;postgres-ext-wasm#installation&quot;&gt;Installation

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the extension is installed, activated and initialized, we can start
having fun!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current API is rather small, however basic features are available.
The goal is to gather a community and to design a pragmatic API
together, discover the expectations, how developers would use this new
technology inside a database engine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how it works. To instantiate a WebAssembly module, we use the
&lt;code&gt;wasm_new_instance&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function. It takes 2 arguments: The absolute path to
the WebAssembly module, and a prefix for the module exported functions.
Indeed, if a module exports a function named &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, then a Postgres
function named &lt;code&gt;prefix_sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; calling the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function will be created
dynamically.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see it in action. Let’s start by editing a Rust program that
compiles to WebAssembly:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;rust&quot; class=&quot;language-rust z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot; data-lang=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;no_mangle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-modifier z-rust&quot;&gt;pub&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-other z-rust&quot;&gt;extern&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;fn&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-entity z-name z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-rust&quot;&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-rust&quot;&gt;y&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-return-type z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-block z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;    x &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-arithmetic z-rust&quot;&gt;+&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; y

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this file compiled to &lt;code&gt;simple.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, we can instantiate the module,
and call the exported &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Et voilà !&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; The &lt;code&gt;ns_sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function calls the Rust &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function through
WebAssembly! How fun is that 😄?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;inspect-a-webassembly-instance&quot;&gt;Inspect a WebAssembly instance&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section shows how to inspect a WebAssembly instance. At the same
time, it quickly explains how the extension works under the hood.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension provides two foreign data wrappers, gathered together in
the &lt;code&gt;wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; foreign schema:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasm.instances&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a table with the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wasm_file&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; columns,
respectively for the unique instance ID, and the path of the WebAssembly
module,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasm.exported_functions&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a table with the &lt;code&gt;instance_id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;name&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;inputs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;outputs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; columns, respectively for the instance ID of the
exported function, its name, its input types (already formatted for Postgres),
and its output types (already formatted for Postgres).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sql&quot; class=&quot;language-sql z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-double-dash z-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-sql&quot;&gt;--&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; Select all WebAssembly instances.

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these information, the &lt;code&gt;wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; Postgres extension is able to
generate the SQL function to call the WebAssembly exported functions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds simplistic, and… to be honest, it is! The trick is to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;fdwhandler.html&quot;&gt;foreign data
wrappers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
which is an awesome feature of Postgres.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-fast-is-it-or-is-it-an-interesting-alternative-to-pl-pgsql&quot;&gt;How fast is it, or: Is it an interesting alternative to PL&#x2F;pgSQL?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said, the extension API is rather small for now. The idea is to
explore, to experiment, to have fun with WebAssembly inside a database.
It is particularly interesting in two cases:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To write extensions or procedures with any languages that compile to
WebAssembly in place of
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;10&#x2F;plpgsql.html&quot;&gt;PL&#x2F;pgSQL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To remove a potential performance bottleneck where speed is
involved.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we run a basic benchmark. Like most of the benchmarks out there, it
must be taken with a grain of salt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to compare the execution time between WebAssembly and
PL&#x2F;pgSQL, and see how both approaches scale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Postgres WebAssembly extension uses
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;fdwhandler.html&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the
runtime, compiled with the Cranelift backend (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;a-webassembly-compiler-tale-9ef37aa3b537&quot;&gt;learn more about the
different
backends&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
We run the benchmark with Postgres 10, on a MacBook Pro 15&quot; from 2016,
2.9Ghz Core i7 with 16Gb of memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methodology is the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load both the &lt;code&gt;plpgsql_fibonacci&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;wasm_fibonacci&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; functions,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run them with a query like
&lt;code&gt;SELECT *_fibonacci(n) FROM generate_series(1, 1000)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; has the
following values: 50, 500, and 5000, so that we can observe how both
approaches scale,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the timings down,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run this methodology multiple times, and compute the median of the
results.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here come the results. The lower, the better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;announcing-the-first-postgres-extension-to-run-webassembly&#x2F;.&#x2F;benchmarks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Benchmarks&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing WebAssembly vs. PL&#x2F;pgSQL when computing the Fibonacci sequence
with n=50, 500 and 5000.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We notice that the Postgres WebAssembly extension is faster to run
numeric computations. The WebAssembly approach scales pretty well
compared to the PL&#x2F;pgSQL approach, &lt;em&gt;in this situation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-to-use-the-webassembly-extension&quot;&gt;When to use the WebAssembly extension?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the extension only supports integers (on 32- and 64-bits). The
extension doesn’t support strings &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It also doesn’t support
records, views or other Postgres types. Keep in mind this is the very
first step.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, it is too soon to tell whether WebAssembly can be an alternative
to PL&#x2F;pgSQL. But regarding the benchmark results above, we are sure they
can live side-by-side, WebAssembly has clearly a place in the ecosystem!
And we want to continue to pursue this exploration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are already talking with people that are interested in using
WebAssembly inside databases. If you have any particular use cases,

&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is a portable binary format. That means the same file can
run anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uphold this bold statement, each language, platform and system must
be able to run WebAssembly — as fast and safely as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a WebAssembly runtime
written in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It goes without saying
that the runtime can be used in any Rust application. We have also
successfully embedded the runtime in other languages:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

🐹!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are super happy to announce &lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,
a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;Go library to run WebAssembly binaries,
fast&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;calling-a-webassembly-function-from-go&quot;&gt;Calling a WebAssembly function from Go&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s install &lt;code&gt;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in your go environment (&lt;em&gt;with cgo
support&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; class=&quot;language-sh z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-modifier z-shell&quot;&gt;export&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-other z-readwrite z-assignment z-shell&quot;&gt;CGO_ENABLED&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-shell&quot;&gt;=&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-string z-unquoted z-shell&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-logical z-continue z-shell&quot;&gt;;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-modifier z-shell&quot;&gt;export&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-other z-readwrite z-assignment z-shell&quot;&gt;CC&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-shell&quot;&gt;=&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-string z-unquoted z-shell&quot;&gt;gcc&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-logical z-continue z-shell&quot;&gt;;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;go&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell&quot;&gt; install github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump immediately into some
examples.&lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a regular Go
library. The installation is automated with
&lt;code&gt;import &quot;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get our hands dirty. We will write a program that compiles to
WebAssembly easily, using Rust for instance:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! We have successfully executed a WebAssembly file inside Go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Go values passed to the WebAssembly exported function are
automatically cast to WebAssembly values. Types are inferred and
casting is done automatically. Thus, a WebAssembly function acts as
any regular Go function.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;webassembly-calling-go-funtions&quot;&gt;WebAssembly calling Go funtions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WebAssembly module &lt;em&gt;exports&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; some functions, so that they can be
called from the outside world. This is the entry point to execute
WebAssembly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, a WebAssembly module can also have &lt;em&gt;imported&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; functions.

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exported function &lt;code&gt;add1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; calls the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function. Its
implementation is absent, only its signature is defined. This is an
“extern function”, and for WebAssembly, this is an &lt;em&gt;imported&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; function,
because its implementation must be &lt;em&gt;imported&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s implement the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function in Go! To do so, &lt;em&gt;need&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.golang.org&#x2F;c-go-cgo&quot;&gt;cgo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function signature is defined in C (see the comment above
&lt;code&gt;import &quot;C&quot;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; implementation is defined in Go. Notice the &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F;export&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which is
the way cgo uses to map Go code to C code,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;NewImports&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is an API used to create WebAssembly imports. In this code
&lt;code&gt;&quot;sum&quot;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the WebAssembly imported function name, &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the Go function
pointer, and &lt;code&gt;C.sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the cgo function pointer,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;NewInstanceWithImports&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the constructor to use to instantiate
the WebAssembly module with imports. That’s it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the complete program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;return_hello&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function returns a pointer as an &lt;code&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; value. We get
its value by calling &lt;code&gt;ToI32&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Then, we fetch the memory data with
&lt;code&gt;instance.Memory.Data()&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function returns a slice over the WebAssembly instance memory. It
can be used as any regular Go slice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for us, we already know the length of the string we want to
read, so &lt;code&gt;memory[pointer : pointer+13]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is enough to read the bytes,
that are then cast to a string. &lt;em&gt;Et voilà !&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;benchmarks&quot;&gt;Benchmarks&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; has a nice API, but
…&lt;em&gt;is it fast&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to PHP or Ruby, there are already existing runtimes in the Go
world to execute WebAssembly. The main candidates are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;perlin-network&#x2F;life&quot;&gt;Life&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, from Perlin Network, a
WebAssembly interpreter&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-interpreter&#x2F;wagon&quot;&gt;Wagon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, from Go Interpreter,
a WebAssembly interpreter and toolkit.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;php-ext-wasm-migrating-from-wasmi-to-wasmer-4d1014f41c88&quot;&gt;our blog post about the PHP
extension&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
we have used &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;description&#x2F;nbody.html&quot;&gt;the n-body
algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
to benchmark the performance. Life provides more benchmarks: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fibonacci_number&quot;&gt;the
Fibonacci algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(the recursive version), &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm&quot;&gt;the Pollard’s rho
algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
the Snappy Compress operation. The latter works successfully with
&lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; but not with Life or Wagon. We
have removed it from the benchmark suites. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;benchmarks&quot;&gt;Benchmark
sources&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
are online.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Life 20190521143330–57f3819c2df0, and Wagon 0.4.0, i.e. &lt;em&gt;the
latest versions to date&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark numbers represent the average result for 10 runs each. The
computer that ran these benchmarks is a MacBook Pro 15&quot; from 2016,
2.9Ghz Core i7 with 16Gb of memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results are grouped by benchmark algorithm on the X axis. The Y axis
represents the time used to run the algorithm, expressed in
milliseconds. The lower, the better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;announcing-the-fastest-webassembly-runtime-for-go-wasmer&#x2F;.&#x2F;benchmarks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Benchmarks&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed comparison between Wasmer, Wagon and Life. Benchmark suites are
the n-body, Fibonacci, and Pollard’s rho algorithms. Speed is expressed
in ms. Lower is better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both Life and Wagon provide on average the same speed, Wasmer
(&lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) is on average &lt;strong&gt;72 times faster&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
🎉.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to know that Wasmer comes with 3 backends:
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;singlepass-backend&quot;&gt;Singlepass&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;clif-backend&quot;&gt;Cranelift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;llvm-backend&quot;&gt;LLVM&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The default backend that is used by the Go library is Cranelift (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CraneStation&#x2F;cranelift&quot;&gt;learn
more about Cranelift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). Using
LLVM will provide performance close to native, but we decided to start
with Cranelift as it offers the best tradeoff between compilation-time
and execution-time (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;a-webassembly-compiler-tale-9ef37aa3b537&quot;&gt;learn more about the different
backends&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
when to use them, pros and cons etc.).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
is a new Go library to execute WebAssembly binaries. It embeds the
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; runtime. The first version
supports all the required API for the most common usages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current benchmarks (a mix from our benchmark suites and from Life
suites) show that &lt;strong&gt;Wasmer is — on average — 72 times faster than Life
and Wagon&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, the two major existing WebAssembly runtimes in the Go
world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow the development, take a look at
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;wasmerio&quot;&gt;@wasmerio&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnt_io&quot;&gt;@mnt_io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Twitter, or

Mastodon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, everything is open source at
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time, we can’t wait to see what you build with us!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://mnt.io/articles/elephant-crab-spider-web-php-ext-wasm-migrating-from-wasmi-to-wasmer/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;php-ext-wasm-migrating-from-wasmi-to-wasmer-4d1014f41c88&quot;&gt;an article I wrote for
Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First as a joke, now as a real product, I started to develop
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;php-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: a
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;php.net&#x2F;&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; extension allowing to execute
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; binaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PHP virtual machine (VM) is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;php&#x2F;php-src&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zend
Engine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. To write an extension, one
needs to develop in C or C++. The extension was simple C bindings to a
Rust library I also wrote. At that time, this Rust library was using
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paritytech&#x2F;wasmi&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the WebAssembly VM. I
knew that &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; wasn’t the fastest WebAssembly VM in the game, but the
API is solid, well-tested, it compiles quickly, and is easy to hack. All
the requirements to start a project!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 6 hours of development, I got something working. I was able to run
the following PHP program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;php&quot; class=&quot;language-php z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-embedding z-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-html z-basic&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-embedded z-block z-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-embedded z-begin z-php&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-embedded z-block z-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-php&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API is straightforward: create an instance (here of &lt;code&gt;simple.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;),
then call functions on it (here &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with 1 and 2 as arguments). PHP
values are transformed into WebAssembly values automatically. For the
record, here is the &lt;code&gt;simple.rs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; Rust program that is compiled to a
WebAssembly binary:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;rust&quot; class=&quot;language-rust z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot; data-lang=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;no_mangle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was great! 6 hours is a relatively small number of hours to go that
far according to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I quickly noticed that &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is… slow. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;One of the promise of
WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;portability&#x2F;#assumptions-for-efficient-execution&quot;&gt;common hardware
capabilities&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
available on a wide range of platforms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And clearly, my extension wasn’t fulfilling this promise. Let’s see a
basic comparison with a benchmark.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;description&#x2F;nbody.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;n-body&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the Computer Language Benchmarks
Game&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from
Debian, mostly because it’s relatively CPU intensive. Also, the
algorithm has a simple interface: based on an integer, it returns a
floating-point number; this API doesn’t involve any advanced instance
memory API, which is perfect to test a proof-of-concept.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a baseline, I’ve run the &lt;em&gt;n-body&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; algorithm &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;program&#x2F;nbody-rust-7.html&quot;&gt;written in
Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
let’s call it &lt;code&gt;rust-baseline&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The same algorithm has been &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;program&#x2F;nbody-php-3.html&quot;&gt;written in
PHP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
let’s call it &lt;code&gt;php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Finally, the algorithm has been compiled from Rust
to WebAssembly, and executed with the &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; extension, let’s
call that case &lt;code&gt;php+wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. All results are for &lt;code&gt;nbody(5000000)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rust-baseline&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 287ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 19,761ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php+wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 67,622ms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so… &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;3.4 times slower&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than PHP
itself, it is pointless to use WebAssembly in such conditions!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It confirms my first intuition though: In our case, &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is really
great to mock something up, but it’s not fast enough for our
expectations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;faster-faster-faster&quot;&gt;Faster, faster, faster…&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CraneStation&#x2F;cranelift&quot;&gt;Cranelift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
since the beginning. It’s a code generator, &lt;em&gt;à la&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;llvm.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;LLVM&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (excuse the brutal shortcut, the goal isn’t to
explain what Cranelift is in details, but that’s a really awesome
project!). To quote the project itself:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranelift is a low-level retargetable code generator. It translates a
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cranelift.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ir.html&quot;&gt;target-independent intermediate
representation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
into executable machine code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It basically means that the Cranelift API can be used to generate
executable code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s perfect! I can replace &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; by Cranelift, and boom, profit. But…
there is other ways to get even faster code execution — at the cost of a
longer code compilation though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, LLVM can provide a very fast code execution, almost at
native speed. Or we can generate assembly code dynamically. Well, there
is multiple ways to achieve that. What if a project could provide a
WebAssembly virtual machine with multiple backends?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-wasmer&quot;&gt;Enter Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was at that specific time that I’ve been hired by
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. To be totally honest, I
was looking at Wasmer a few weeks before. It was a surprise and a great
opportunity for me. Well, the universe really wants this rewrite from
&lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to Wasmer, right 😅?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer is organized as a set of Rust libraries (called crates). There is
even a &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; crate which is a C and a C++ API on top of
the &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; crate and the &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-core&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; crate, i.e. it
allows running the WebAssembly virtual machine as you want, with the
backend of your choice: &lt;em&gt;Cranelift&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;LLVM&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Dynasm&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (at the time of
writing). That’s perfect, it removes my Rust library between the PHP
extension and &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Then &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is reduced to a PHP extension
without any Rust code, everything goes to &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. That’s
sad to remove Rust from this project, but it relies on more Rust code!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting the time to make some patches on &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, I’ve
been able to migrate &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to Wasmer in 5 days.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; uses Wasmer with the Cranelift backend, it
does a great balance between compilation and execution time. It is
really good. Let’s run the benchmark, with the addition of
&lt;code&gt;php+wasmer(cranelift)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rust-baseline&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 287ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 19,761ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php+wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 67,622ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php+wasmer(cranelift)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 2,365ms 🎉.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the PHP extension provides a faster execution than PHP itself!
&lt;code&gt;php+wasmer(cranelift)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;8.6 times faster&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than &lt;code&gt;php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to be exact.
And it is &lt;strong&gt;28.6 times faster&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than &lt;code&gt;php+wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Can we reach the
native speed (represented by &lt;code&gt;rust-baseline&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; here)? It’s very likely
with LLVM. That’s for another article. I’m super happy with Cranelift
for the moment. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;benchmarking-webassembly-runtimes-18497ce0d76e&quot;&gt;our previous blog post to learn how we benchmark
different backends in Wasmer, and other WebAssembly
runtimes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-optimizations&quot;&gt;More Optimizations&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer provides more features, like module caching. Those features are
now included in the PHP extension. When booting the &lt;code&gt;nbody.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file
(19kb), it took 4.2ms. By booting, I mean: reading the WebAssembly
binary from a file, parsing it, validating it, compiling it to
executable code and a WebAssembly module structure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP execution model is: starts, runs, dies. Memory is freed for each
request. If one wants to use &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, you don’t really want to
pay that “&lt;em&gt;booting cost&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;” every time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; now provides a module serialization
API, which is integrated into the PHP extension itself. It saves the
“booting cost”, but it adds a “deserialization cost”. That second cost
is smaller, but still, we need to know it exists.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully again, Zend Engine has an API to get persistent in-memory data
between PHP executions. &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; supports that API to get
persistent modules, &lt;em&gt;et voilà&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it takes &lt;strong&gt;4.2ms&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for the first boot of &lt;code&gt;nbody.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;0.005ms&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for all the next boots. It’s 840 times faster!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer is a young — but mature — framework to build WebAssembly runtimes
on top of. The default backend is Cranelift, and it shows its promises:
It brings a correct balance between compilation time and execution time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; has been a good companion to develop a &lt;em&gt;Proof-Of-Concept&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. This
library has its place in other usages though, like very short-living
WebAssembly binaries (I’m thinking of Ethereum contracts that compile to
WebAssembly for instance, which is one of the actual use cases). It’s
important to understand that no runtime is better than another, it
depends on the use case.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to stabilize &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to release a 1.0.0 version.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-automattic-hello-wasmer/">&lt;p&gt;Today is my first day at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasmer.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s with a lot of regrets that I leave Automattic. To be clear, I&#x27;m not
leaving because something negative happened, I&#x27;m leaving because I&#x27;ve
received the same job offer, 3 times in 10 days, from Wasmer, Google and
Mozilla. Namely to work with Rust or C++ to build a WebAssembly runtime.
This is an offer I can barely decline. It&#x27;s an opportunity and a dream
for me. And I was lucky enough to get a choice between 3 excellent
companies!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only encourage you to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;automattic.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;&quot;&gt;work with
Automattic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s definitely the
best company I&#x27;ve ever work with; stealing the 1st place to Mozilla.
Automattic is not only about WordPress.com and other services: It&#x27;s a
way of living. The culture, the spirit, the interactions between people,
the mission, everything is &lt;em&gt;exceptional&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It has been a super great
experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could write 100 pages about my team. They have all been &lt;em&gt;remarkable&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
in many ways. I&#x27;m closer to them although they live at 10&#x27;000km, rather
than colleagues I met everyday in person in the past. Congrats to
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ma.tt&#x2F;about&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for this incredible project.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&#x27;s time to work on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
It&#x27;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; runtime written in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: My two current passions. It&#x27;s
powerful, modular, well-designed, and it comes with great ambitions. I&#x27;m
really exciting. I work with an extraordinary team: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;syrusakbary&quot;&gt;Syrus

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://mnt.io/series/from-rust-to-beyond/the-asm-js-galaxy/">&lt;p&gt;The second galaxy that our Rust parser will explore is the ASM.js
galaxy. This post will explain what ASM.js is, how to compile the parser
into ASM.js, and how to use the ASM.js module with Javascript in a
browser. The goal is to use ASM.js as a fallback to WebAssembly when it
is not available. I highly recommend to read &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;series&#x2F;from-rust-to-beyond&#x2F;the-webassembly-galaxy&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the previous
episode&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
about WebAssembly since they have a lot in common.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-asm-js-and-why&quot;&gt;What is ASM.js, and why?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main programming language on the Web is Javascript. Applications
that want to exist on the Web had to compile to Javascript, like for
example games. But a problem occurs: The resulting file is heavy (hence
WebAssembly) and Javascript virtual machines have difficulties to
optimise this particular code, resulting in slow or inefficient
executions (considering the example of games). Also —in this context—
Javascript is a compilation target, and as such, some language
constructions are useless (like &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if a “new” language can be a compilation target and still be
executed by Javascript virtual machines? This is WebAssembly today, but
in 2013, the solution was &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;asmjs.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ASM.js&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;asm.js&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, a strict subset of Javascript that can be used as a
low-level, efficient target language for compilers. This sublanguage
effectively describes a sandboxed virtual machine for memory-unsafe
languages like C or C++. A combination of static and dynamic
validation allows Javascript engines to employ an ahead-of-time (AOT)
optimizing compilation strategy for valid asm.js code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So an ASM.js program is a regular Javascript program. It is not a new
language but a subset of it. It can be executed by any Javascript
virtual machines. However, the specific usage of the magic statement
&lt;code&gt;&#x27;use asm&#x27;;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; instructs the virtual machine to optimise the program with
an ASM.js “engine”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASM.js introduces types by using arithmetical operators as an annotation
system. For instance, &lt;code&gt;x | 0&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; annotes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to be an integer, &lt;code&gt;+x&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
annotates &lt;code&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to be a double, and &lt;code&gt;fround(x)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; annotates &lt;code&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to be a
float. The following example declares a function
&lt;code&gt;fn increment(x: u32) -&amp;gt; u32&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; class=&quot;language-js z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-function z-ts&quot;&gt;function&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-definition z-function z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-entity z-name z-function z-ts&quot;&gt;increment&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-parameters z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameters z-begin z-ts&quot;&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-ts&quot;&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameters z-end z-ts&quot;&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-block z-ts&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-ts&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-flow z-ts&quot;&gt;return&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-brace z-round z-ts&quot;&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-other z-readwrite z-ts&quot;&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-arithmetic z-ts&quot;&gt;+&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-constant z-numeric z-decimal z-ts&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-brace z-round z-ts&quot;&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-bitwise z-ts&quot;&gt;|&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-constant z-numeric z-decimal z-ts&quot;&gt;0&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-terminator z-statement z-ts&quot;&gt;;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-block z-ts&quot;&gt;}&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important difference is that ASM.js works by module in order to
isolate them from Javascript. A module is a function that takes 3
arguments:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;stdlib&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, an object with references to standard library APIs,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreign&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, an object with user-defined functionalities (such as
sending something over a WebSocket),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;heap&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, an array buffer representing the memory (because memory is
manually managed).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#x27;s still Javascript. So the good news is that if your virtual
machine has no specific optimisations for ASM.js, it is executed as any
regular Javascript program. And if it does, then you get a pleasant
boost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;series&#x2F;from-rust-to-beyond&#x2F;the-asm-js-galaxy&#x2F;.&#x2F;asm-benchmarks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Firefox, Firefox + asm.js, Google, and native.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that ASM.js has been designed to be a compilation target. So
normally you don&#x27;t have to care about that because it is the role of the
compiler. The typical compilation and execution pipeline from C or C++
to the Web looks like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;series&#x2F;from-rust-to-beyond&#x2F;the-asm-js-galaxy&#x2F;.&#x2F;asm-pipeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pipeline&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

schema above, is a very important project in this whole evolution of the
Web platform. Emscripten is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a toolchain for compiling to asm.js and WebAssembly, built using LLVM,
that lets you run C and C++ on the web at near-native speed without
plugins.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are very likely to see this name one day or another if you work with
ASM.js or WebAssembly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not explain deeply what ASM.js is with a lot of examples. I
recommend instead to read &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;johnresig.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;asmjs-javascript-compile-target&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Asm.js: The Javascript Compile
Target&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by
John Resig, or &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kripken.github.io&#x2F;mloc_emscripten_talk&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Big Web app? Compile
it!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Alon Zakai.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our process will be different though. We will not compile our Rust code
directly to ASM.js, but instead, we will compile it to WebAssembly,
which in turn will be compiled into ASM.js.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode will be very short, and somehow the most easiest one. To
compile Rust to ASM.js, you need to first compile it to WebAssembly
(&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;series&#x2F;from-rust-to-beyond&#x2F;the-webassembly-galaxy&#x2F;&quot;&gt;see the previous
episode&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;),
and then compile the WebAssembly binary into ASM.js.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, ASM.js is mostly required when the browser does not support
WebAssembly, like Internet Explorer. It is essentially a fallback to run
our program on the Web.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workflow is the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile your Rust project into WebAssembly,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile your WebAssembly binary into an ASM.js module,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimise and shrink the ASM.js module.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;binaryen&quot;&gt;The wasm2js tool&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will be your
best companion to compile the WebAssembly binary into an ASM.js module.
It is part of Binaryen project. Then, assuming we have the WebAssembly
binary of our program, all we have to do is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; class=&quot;language-sh z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell&quot;&gt; wasm2js&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt; --&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;pedantic&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt; --&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;output&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; gutenberg_post_parser.asm.js gutenberg_post_parser.wasm&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this step, the &lt;code&gt;gutenberg_post_parser.asm.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; weights 212kb. The file
contains ECMAScript 6 code. And remember that old browsers are
considered, like Internet Explorer, so the code needs to be transformed
a little bit. To optimise and shrink the ASM.js module, we will use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mishoo&#x2F;UglifyJS2&#x2F;tree&#x2F;harmony&quot;&gt;the
&lt;code&gt;uglify-es&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; tool&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; class=&quot;language-sh z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;$ &lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt; Transform code, and embed in a function.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We end up with the following file sizes:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.asm.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 54kb,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.asm.js.gz&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 13kb,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.asm.js.br&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 11kb.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s again pretty small!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, this is a lot of transformations: From Rust to
WebAssembly to Javascript&#x2F;ASM.js… The amount of tools is rather small
compared to the amount of work. It shows a well-designed pipeline and a
collaboration between many groups of people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: If you are reading this post, I assume you are developers. And as
such, I&#x27;m sure you can spend hours looking at a source code like if it
is a master painting. Did you ever wonder what a Rust program looks like
once compiled to Javascript? See bellow:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;asm-js-rocket-javascript&quot;&gt;ASM.js 🚀 Javascript&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting &lt;code&gt;gutenberg_post_parser.asm.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file contains a single
function named &lt;code&gt;GUTENBERG_POST_PARSER_ASM_MODULE&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which returns an
object pointing to 4 private functions:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, the axiom of our grammar,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;alloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, to allocate memory,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;dealloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, to deallocate memory, and&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;memory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, the memory buffer.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds familiar if you have read &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;series&#x2F;from-rust-to-beyond&#x2F;the-webassembly-galaxy&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the previous episode with
WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Don&#x27;t expect &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to return a full AST: It will return a pointer to
the memory, and the data need to be encoded and decoded, and to write
into and to read from the memory the same way. Yes, the same way. &lt;em&gt;The
exact same way&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. So the code of the boundary layer is strictly the same.
Do you remember the &lt;code&gt;Module&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; object in our WebAssembly Javascript
boundary? This is exactly what the &lt;code&gt;GUTENBERG_POST_PARSER_ASM_MODULE&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
function returns. You can replace &lt;code&gt;Module&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; by the returned object, &lt;em&gt;et
voilà&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hywan&#x2F;gutenberg-parser-rs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;bindings&#x2F;asmjs&#x2F;bin&#x2F;gutenberg_post_parser.asm.mjs&quot;&gt;The entired code lands
here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
It completely reuses the Javascript boundary layer for WebAssembly. It
just sets the &lt;code&gt;Module&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; differently, and it does not load the WebAssembly
binary. Consequently, the ASM.js boundary layer is made of 34 lines of
code, only 🙃. It compresses to 218 bytes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen that ASM.js can be fallback to WebAssembly in environments
that only support Javascript (like Internet Explorer), with or without
ASM.js optimisations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting ASM.js file and its boundary layer are quite small. By
design, the ASM.js boundary layer reuses almost the entire WebAssembly
boundary layer. Therefore there is again a tiny surface of code to
review and to maintain, which is helpful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen in the previous episode that Rust is very fast. We have
been able to observe the same statement for WebAssembly compared to the
actual Javascript parser for the Gutenberg project. However, is it still
true for the ASM.js module? In this case, ASM.js is a fallback, and like
all fallbacks, they are notably slower than the targeted
implementations. Let&#x27;s run the same benchmark but use the Rust parser as
an ASM.js module:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benchmark between Javascript parser and Rust parser as an ASM.js module.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASM.js module of the Rust parser is in average 6 times faster than
the actual Javascript implementation. The median speedup is 6. That&#x27;s
far from the WebAssembly results, but this is a fallback, and in
average, it is 6 times faster, which is really great!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not only the whole pipeline is safer because it starts from Rust, but
it ends to be faster than Javascript.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see in the next episodes of this series that Rust can reach a
lot of galaxies, and the more it travels, the more it gets interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://mnt.io/series/from-rust-to-beyond/the-webassembly-galaxy/">&lt;p&gt;The first galaxy that our Rust parser will explore is the WebAssembly
(Wasm) galaxy. This post will explain what WebAssembly is, how to
compile the parser into WebAssembly, and how to use the WebAssembly
binary with Javascript in a browser and with NodeJS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-webassembly-and-why&quot;&gt;What is WebAssembly, and why?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already know WebAssembly, you can skip this section.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; defines itself as:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly (abbreviated &lt;em&gt;Wasm&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) is a binary instruction format for a
stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for
compilation of high-level languages like C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust, enabling
deployment on the web for client and server applications.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I say more? Probably, yes…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is a &lt;em&gt;new portable binary format&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Languages like C, C++, or
Rust already compiles to this target. It is the spirit successor of
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;asmjs.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ASM.js&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. By spirit successor, I mean it is the same
people trying to extend the Web platform and to make the Web fast that
are working on both technologies. They share some design concepts too,
but that&#x27;s not really important right now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before WebAssembly, programs had to compile to Javascript in order to
run on the Web platform. The resulting files were most of the time
large. And because the Web is a network, the files had to be downloaded,
and it took time. WebAssembly is designed to be encoded in a size- and
load-time efficient &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;binary-encoding&#x2F;&quot;&gt;binary
format&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is also faster than Javascript for many reasons. Despites
all the crazy optimisations engineers put in the Javascript virtual
machines, Javascript is a weakly and dynamically typed language, which
requires to be interpreted. WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed
by taking advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;portability&#x2F;#assumptions-for-efficient-execution&quot;&gt;common hardware
capabilities&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacks.mozilla.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebAssembly also loads faster than
Javascript&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
because parsing and compiling happen while the binary is streamed from
the network. So once the binary is entirely fetched, it is ready to run:
No need to wait on the parser and the compiler before running the
program.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, and our blog series is a perfect example of that, it is possible
to write a Rust program, and to compile it to run on the Web platform.
Why? Because WebAssembly is implemented by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caniuse.com&#x2F;#search=wasm&quot;&gt;all major
browsers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and because it has been
designed for the Web: To live and run on the Web platform (like a
browser). But its portable aspect and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;semantics&#x2F;#linear-memory&quot;&gt;its safe and sandboxed memory
design&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; make it a
good candidate to run outside of the Web platform (see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geal&#x2F;serverless-wasm&quot;&gt;a serverless
Wasm framework&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;losfair&#x2F;IceCore&quot;&gt;an
application container built for
Wasm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to remind that WebAssembly is not here to
replace Javascript. It is just another technology which solves many
problems we can meet today, like load-time, safety, or speed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;figure role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;series&#x2F;from-rust-to-beyond&#x2F;the-webassembly-galaxy&#x2F;.&#x2F;rust-to-wasm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rust to Wasm&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rustwasm&#x2F;team&quot;&gt;The Rust Wasm team&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a group of
people leading the effort of pushing Rust into WebAssembly with a set of
tools and integrations. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rustwasm.github.io&#x2F;book&#x2F;&quot;&gt;There is a
book&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; explaining how to write a
WebAssembly program with Rust.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Gutenberg Rust parser, I didn&#x27;t use tools like
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rustwasm&#x2F;wasm-bindgen&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasm-bindgen&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (which is a
pure gem) when I started the project few months ago because I hit some
limitations. Note that some of them have been addressed since then!
Anyway, we will do most of the work by hand, and I think this is an
excellent way to understand how things work in the background. When you
are familiar with WebAssembly interactions, then &lt;code&gt;wasm-bindgen&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is an
excellent tool to have within easy reach, because it abstracts all the
interactions and let you focus on your code logic instead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to remind the reader that the Gutenberg Rust parser exposes
one AST, and one &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function (the axiom of the grammar),
respectively defined as:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that, let&#x27;s go!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-design&quot;&gt;General design&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is our general design or workflow:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript (for instance) writes the blog post to parse into the WebAssembly
module memory,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript runs the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function by passing a pointer to the memory, and
the length of the blog post,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rust reads the blog post from the memory, runs the Gutenberg parser, compiles
the resulting AST into a sequence of bytes, and returns the pointer to this
sequence of bytes to Javascript,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript reads the memory from the received pointer, and decodes the
sequence of bytes as Javascript objects in order to recreate an AST with a
friendly API.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why a sequence of bytes? Because WebAssembly only supports integers and
floats, not strings or vectors, and also because our Rust parser takes a
slice of bytes as input, so this is handy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the term &lt;em&gt;boundary layer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to refer to this Javascript piece of
code responsible to read from and write into the WebAssembly module
memory, and responsible of exposing a friendly API.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we will focus on the Rust code. It consists of only 4 functions:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;alloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to allocate memory (exported),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;dealloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to deallocate memory (exported),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to run the parser (exported),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;into_bytes&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to transform the AST into a sequence of bytes.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hywan&#x2F;gutenberg-parser-rs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;bindings&#x2F;wasm&#x2F;src&#x2F;lib.rs&quot;&gt;The entire code lands
here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
It is approximately 150 lines of code. We explain it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;memory-allocation&quot;&gt;Memory allocation&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s start by the memory allocator. I choose to use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rustwasm&#x2F;wee_alloc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wee_alloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for
the memory allocator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It is
specifically designed for WebAssembly by being very small (less than a
kilobyte) and efficient.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following piece of code describes the memory allocator setup and the
“prelude” for our code (enabling some compiler features, like &lt;code&gt;alloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,
declaring external crates, some aliases, and declaring required function
like &lt;code&gt;panic&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;oom&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; etc.). This can be considered as a boilerplate:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rust memory is the WebAssembly memory. Rust will allocate and
deallocate memory on its own, but Javascript for instance needs to
allocate and deallocate WebAssembly memory in order to
communicate&#x2F;exchange data. So we need to export one function to allocate
memory and one function to deallocate memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, this is almost a boilerplate. The &lt;code&gt;alloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function creates

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;code&gt;#[no_mangle]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; attribute that instructs the Rust compiler to
not mangle the function name, i.e. to not rename it. And &lt;code&gt;extern &quot;C&quot;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to
export the function in the WebAssembly module, so it is “public” from
outside the WebAssembly binary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is pretty straightforward and matches what we announced
earlier: A &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is allocated with a specific capacity, and the pointer
to this vector is returned. The important part is &lt;code&gt;mem::forget(buffer)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.
It is required so that Rust will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; deallocate the vector once it
goes out of scope. Indeed, Rust enforces &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Resource_acquisition_is_initialization&quot;&gt;Resource Acquisition Is
Initialization
(RAII)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
so whenever an object goes out of scope, its destructor is called and
its owned resources are freed. This behavior shields against resource
leaks bugs, and this is why we will never have to manually free memory
or worry about memory leaks in Rust (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;rust-by-example&#x2F;scope&#x2F;raii.html&quot;&gt;see some RAII
examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
In this case, we want to allocate and keep the allocation after the
function execution, hence &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;std&#x2F;mem&#x2F;fn.forget.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;mem::forget&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
call&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s jump on the &lt;code&gt;dealloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function. The goal is to recreate a vector
based on a pointer and a capacity, and to let Rust drops it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the core of the binding! The &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function reads the blog post to
parse based on a pointer and a length, then it parses it. If the result
is OK, it serializes the AST into a sequence of bytes, i.e. it flatten
it, otherwise it returns an empty sequence of bytes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variable &lt;code&gt;input&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; contains the blog post. It is fetched from memory
with a pointer and a length. The variable &lt;code&gt;output&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the sequence of
bytes the function will return. &lt;code&gt;gutenberg_post_parser::root(input)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
runs the parser. If parsing is OK, then the &lt;code&gt;nodes&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; are compiled into a
sequence of bytes (omitted for now). Then the pointer to the sequence of
bytes is grabbed, the Rust compiler is instructed to not drop it, and
finally the pointer is returned. The logic is again pretty
straightforward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&#x27;s focus on the AST to the sequence of bytes (&lt;code&gt;u8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) compilation.
All data the AST hold are already bytes, which makes the process easier.
The goal is only to flatten the AST:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first 4 bytes represent the number of nodes at the first level (4
× &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; represents &lt;code&gt;u32&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) ,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, if the node is &lt;code&gt;Block&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first byte is the node type: &lt;code&gt;1u8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for a block,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second byte is the size of the block name,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third to the sixth bytes are the size of the attributes,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seventh byte is the number of node children the block has,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next bytes are the block name,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next bytes are the attributes (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;b&quot;null&quot;[..]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; if none),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next bytes are node children as a sequence of bytes,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, if the node is &lt;code&gt;Phrase&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first byte is the node type: &lt;code&gt;2u8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for a phrase,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second to the fifth bytes are the size of the phrase,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next bytes are the phrase.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the missing part of the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a WebAssembly binary, the project has to be compiled to the
&lt;code&gt;wasm32-unknown-unknown&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; target. For now (and it will change in a near
future), the nightly toolchain is needed to compile the project, so make
sure you have the latest nightly version of &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; &amp;amp; co. installed with
&lt;code&gt;rustup update nightly&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Let&#x27;s run &lt;code&gt;cargo&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; class=&quot;language-sh z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell&quot;&gt; RUSTFLAGS=&lt;span class=&quot;z-string z-quoted z-single z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;-g&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-end z-shell&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; cargo +nightly build&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt; --&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;target&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; wasm32-unknown-unknown&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt; --&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;release&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WebAssembly binary weights 22kb. Our goal is to reduce the file
size. For that, the following tools will be required:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexcrichton&#x2F;wasm-gc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasm-gc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to garbage-collect unused
imports, internal functions, types etc.,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rustwasm&#x2F;wasm-snip&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasm-snip&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to mark some functions as
unreachable, this is useful when the binary includes unused code that the
linker were not able to remove,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasm-opt&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;binaryen&quot;&gt;Binaryen
project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, to optimise the

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gzip.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gzip&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and

&lt;p&gt;We end up with the following file sizes:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 16kb,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.wasm.gz&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 7.3kb,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neat! &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caniuse.com&#x2F;#search=brotli&quot;&gt;Brotli is implemented by most
browsers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, so when the client sends
&lt;code&gt;Accept-Encoding: br&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, the server can response with the &lt;code&gt;.wasm.br&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you a feeling of what 6.2kb represent, the following image also
weights 6.2kb:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we assume Javascript runs in a browser. Thus, what we
need to do is the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load&#x2F;stream and instanciate the WebAssembly binary,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the blog post to parse in the WebAssembly module memory,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function on the parser,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the WebAssembly module memory to load the flat AST (a sequence of bytes)
and decode it to build a “Javascript AST” (with our own objects).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hywan&#x2F;gutenberg-parser-rs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;bindings&#x2F;wasm&#x2F;bin&#x2F;gutenberg_post_parser.mjs&quot;&gt;The entire code lands
here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
It is approximately 150 lines of code too. I won&#x27;t explain the whole
code since some parts of it is the “friendly API” that is exposed to the
user. So I will rather explain the major pieces.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;loading-streaming-and-instanciating&quot;&gt;Loading&#x2F;streaming and instanciating&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;Global_Objects&#x2F;WebAssembly&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
API&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
exposes multiple ways to load a WebAssembly binary. The best you can use
is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;Global_Objects&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;instantiateStreaming&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;WebAssembly.instanciateStreaming&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
function&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:
It streams the binary and compiles it in the same time, nothing is
blocking. This API relies on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;API&#x2F;Fetch_API&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;Fetch&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
API&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. You
might have guessed it: It is asynchronous (it returns a promise).
WebAssembly itself is not asynchronous (except if you use thread), but
the instanciation step is. It is possible to avoid that, but this is
tricky, and Google Chrome has a strong limit of 4kb for the binary size
which will make you give up quickly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to stream the WebAssembly binary, the server must send the
&lt;code&gt;application&#x2F;wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; MIME type (with the &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; header).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s instanciate our WebAssembly:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WebAssembly binary has been instanciated! Now we can move to the
next step.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-polish-before-running-the-parser&quot;&gt;Last polish before running the parser&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that the WebAssembly binary exports 3 functions: &lt;code&gt;alloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;dealloc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. They can be found on the &lt;code&gt;exports&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; property,

parse) in the WebAssembly module memory (&lt;code&gt;Module.memory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;), to call the

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In details:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;raw_input&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is encoded into a sequence of bytes with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;API&#x2F;TextEncoder&quot;&gt;the
&lt;code&gt;TextEncoder&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;API&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
in &lt;code&gt;input&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The input is written into the WebAssembly memory module with
&lt;code&gt;writeBuffer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and its pointer is returned,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function is called with the pointer to the input and
the length of the input as expected, and the pointer to the output is
returned,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the output is decoded,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, the input is deallocated. The output of the parser will
be deallocated in the &lt;code&gt;readNodes&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function because its length is
unknown at this step.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! So we have 2 functions to write right now: &lt;code&gt;writeBuffer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;​ and
&lt;code&gt;readNodes&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In details:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The length of the buffer is read in &lt;code&gt;buffer_length&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A space in memory is allocated to write the buffer,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then a &lt;code&gt;uint8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; view of the buffer is instanciated, which means that
the buffer will be viewed as a sequence of &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, exactly what Rust
expects,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally the buffer is copied into the memory with a loop, that&#x27;s very
basic, and return the pointer.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, unlike C strings, adding a &lt;code&gt;NUL&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; byte at the end is not
mandatory. This is just the raw data (on the Rust side, we read it with
&lt;code&gt;slice::from_raw_parts&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, slice is a very simple structure).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reading-the-output-of-the-parser&quot;&gt;Reading the output of the parser&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at this step, the input has been written in memory, and the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
function has been called so it means the parser has run. It has returned
a pointer to the output (the result) and we now have to read it and
decode it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remind that the first 4 bytes encodes the number of nodes we have to
read. Let&#x27;s go!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;uint8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; view of the memory is instanciated… more precisely: A slice
of the memory starting at &lt;code&gt;start_pointer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of nodes is read, then all nodes are read,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, the output of the parser is deallocated.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, here is the &lt;code&gt;u8s_to_u32&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function, this is the exact
opposite of &lt;code&gt;u32_to_u8s&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this code is pretty simple and easy to optimise by the
Javascript virtual machine. It is almost important to note that this is
not the original code. The original version is a little more optimised
here and there, but they are very close.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#x27;s all! We have successfully read and decoded the output of the
parser! We just need to write the &lt;code&gt;Block&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Phrase&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; classes like

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences between the Javascript version and the NodeJS version
are few:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Fetch&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; API does not exist in NodeJS, so the WebAssembly binary
has to be instanciated with a buffer directly, like this:
&lt;code&gt;WebAssembly.instantiate(fs.readFileSync(url), {})&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;TextEncoder&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TextDecoder&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; objects do not exist as global
objects, they are in &lt;code&gt;util.TextEncoder&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;util.TextDecoder&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to share the code between both environments, it is possible to
write the boundary layer (the Javascript code we wrote) in a &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
file, aka ECMAScript Module. It allows to write something like
&lt;code&gt;import { Gutenberg_Post_Parser } from &#x27;.&#x2F;gutenberg_post_parser.mjs&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
for example (considering the whole code we wrote before is a class). On
the browser side, the script must be loaded
with&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;…&quot; &#x2F;&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and on the NodeJS side, &lt;code&gt;node&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
must run with the &lt;code&gt;--experimental-modules&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; flag. I can recommend you

Borins&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
at the JSConf EU 2018 to understand all the story about that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen in details how to write a real world parser in Rust, how to
compile it into a WebAssembly binary, and how to use it with Javascript
and with NodeJS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parser can be used in a browser with regular Javascript code, or as
a CLI with NodeJS, or on any platforms NodeJS supports.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust part for WebAssembly plus the Javascript part totals 313 lines
of code. This is a tiny surface of code to review and to maintain
compared to writing a Javascript parser from scratch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument is the safety and performance. Rust is memory safe, we
know that. It is also performant, but is it still true for the
WebAssembly target? The following table shows the benchmark results of
the actual Javascript parser for the Gutenberg project (implemented with
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pegjs.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;PEG.js&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), against this project: The Rust parser as
a WebAssembly binary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks between Javascript parser and Rust parser as a WebAssembly binary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WebAssembly binary is in average 86 times faster than the actual
Javascript implementation. The median of the speedup is 98. Some edge
cases are very interesting, like &lt;code&gt;moby-dick-parsed.html&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; where it takes
2.5s with the Javascript parser against 25ms with WebAssembly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not only it is safer, but it is faster than Javascript in this case.
And it is only 300 lines of code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that WebAssembly does not support SIMD yet: It is still &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;simd&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;simd&#x2F;SIMD.md&quot;&gt;a
proposal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Rust is gently supporting it (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang-nursery&#x2F;stdsimd&#x2F;pull&#x2F;549&quot;&gt;example with PR
#549&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). It will
dramatically improve the performances!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see in the next episodes of this series that Rust can reach a
lot of galaxies, and the more it travels, the more it gets interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
