          <description xml:base="https://mnt.io/articles/i-leave-wasmer/">&lt;p&gt;This article could also have been titled &lt;em&gt;How I failed to change
Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasmer.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For those who
don&#x27;t know this name, it has a twofold meaning: it&#x27;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;very popular
WebAssembly runtime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as well as a
startup. I want to write about what I&#x27;ve been able to accomplish during
my time at Wasmer (a high overview, not a technical view), and what
&lt;em&gt;forces&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; me to leave the company despite being one of its co-founder. I
reckon my testimony can help other people to avoid digging into the hell
I (and my colleagues) had to endure. I&#x27;m available for work, you can
contact me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ivan@mnt.io&quot;&gt;ivan@mnt.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnt_io&quot;&gt;@mnt_io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;ivan-enderlin&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ivan-enderlin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (LinkedIn).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-nothing-to-pure-awesomeness&quot;&gt;From nothing to pure awesomeness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve joined the Wasmer company at its early beginning, in March 2019.
The company was 3 months old. My initial role was to write and to
improve the runtime itself, and to create many embeddings, i.e. ways to
integrate the Wasmer runtime inside various technologies, so that
WebAssembly can run everywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say with confidence that my work is a success. I&#x27;ve learned a lot,
and I&#x27;ve worked on so many different projects, technologies, hacked so
many things, collaborated with so many people, every action was led by
the &lt;strong&gt;passion&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, Wasmer has an incredible growth. In 2.5 years
only, the runtime has more than 10&#x27;500 stars on Github, and is &lt;strong&gt;one of
the most popular WebAssembly runtime in the world&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;! It&#x27;s used by many
various companies, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;confio.tech&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Confio&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluence.network&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Fluence
Labs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hotg.dev&#x2F;&quot;&gt;HOT-G&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Brave&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Google&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacemesh.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;SpaceMesh&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkerd.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Linkerd&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.singlestore.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;SingleStore&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clever-cloud.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CleverCloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;konghq.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kong&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to name a few (for the ones I can name
though, however other companies are also using Wasmer in very critical
environments).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my engineering job happened on the Wasmer runtime itself. At the
time of writing, I&#x27;m the #2 contributor on the project. I was working
on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;f9ff574e10d4ee97f836565bdae99035e04ac879&#x2F;lib&quot;&gt;every parts of the
runtime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:
the API, the C API, the compilers, the ABI (mostly WASI), the engines,
the middlewares, and the VM itself which is the most low-level
foundamental layer of the runtime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The runtime provides so many features. It is an impressively powerful
runtime for WebAssembly, and I&#x27;m saying that with a neutral and
respectful mindset. Not everything is perfect obviously but I did my
best to set up a truly user-friendly learning environment, with an
important documentation and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;f9ff574e10d4ee97f836565bdae99035e04ac879&#x2F;examples&quot;&gt;a collection of
examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
that illustrate many features. I strongly believe it contributed to
Wasmer&#x27;s popularity to great extent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to highlight the most notable embedding projects I&#x27;ve
created:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;c-api&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
is the C embedding for Wasmer. It&#x27;s part of the Wasmer runtime itself,
and is fully written in Rust. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;wasmer-c-api&#x2F;*&#x2F;wasmer_c_api&#x2F;wasm_c_api&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;The documentation, the C
examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
everything is super polished to offer the best experience possible.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MarkMcCaskey&quot;&gt;Mark McCaskey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and I are the authors
of this project.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-python&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the
Python embedding for Wasmer. At the time of writing, it&#x27;s been
installed more than 5 millions times (I&#x27;m counting the compiler
packages too, like &lt;code&gt;wasmer-compiler-cranelift&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and so on), and 1300
stars on Github. There is about 300&#x27;000 downloads per months, and it
continues to grow! The code is written in Rust, and it relies on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyo3.rs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the
awesome &lt;code&gt;pyo3&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-go&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-go&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the Go
embedding for Wasmer. It&#x27;s hard to know how much total downloads we
have because of how the Go ecosystem is designed, but we have about
60&#x27;000 downloads per months from Github (I&#x27;m excluding the forks of
the project), and 1600 stars on Github. The code is written in Go and
uses &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;cmd&#x2F;cgo&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cgo&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to bind against the C API.
Almost all blockchain projects that use WebAssembly are using
&lt;code&gt;wasmer-go&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, which is a popularity I wasn&#x27;t expecting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-ruby&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-ruby&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the Ruby
embedding for Wasmer. It&#x27;s not as popular as the others, but it&#x27;s also
very polished and it&#x27;s finding its place in the Ruby ecosystem. The
code is written in Rust, and it relies on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danielpclark&#x2F;rutie&quot;&gt;the awesome &lt;code&gt;rutie&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I won&#x27;t detail all the projects, but there is also
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-php&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-java&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-postgres&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-postgres&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;…
Because of the Wasmer runtime API and C API we have designed, many
developers around the globe have been able to create a lot more
embeddings, such as in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;migueldeicaza&#x2F;WasmerSharp&quot;&gt;C#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chances&#x2F;wasmer-d&quot;&gt;D&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tessi&#x2F;wasmex&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dirkschumacher&#x2F;wasmr&quot;&gt;R&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AlwaysRightInstitute&#x2F;SwiftyWasmer&quot;&gt;Swift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zigwasm&#x2F;wasmer-zig&quot;&gt;Zig&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dart-lang&#x2F;wasm&quot;&gt;Dart&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;helmutkian&#x2F;cl-wasm-runtime&quot;&gt;Lisp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and so on.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fun notable projects are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;sonde-rs&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sonde-rs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a library to
compile USDT probes into a Rust library,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;llvm-custom-builds&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;llvm-custom-builds&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
a sandbox to produce custom LLVM builds for various platforms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;loupe&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;loupe&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a set of tools to
analyse and to profile Rust code,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;interface-types&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-interface-types&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
a “living” (understand an unstable playground) library that implements
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;interface-types&quot;&gt;the WebAssembly Interface Types
proposal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hywan&#x2F;inline-c-rs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;inline-c-rs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, to write and
to execute C code inside Rust,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-memory filesystem, that acts exactly like &lt;code&gt;std::fs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might think, I&#x27;ve learned so much. The impostor syndrom was very
present because I was constantly trying to do something I didn&#x27;t know.
It&#x27;s part of the routine at Wasmer: Trying something for the first time.
But it&#x27;s also what kept me motivated, and it was the energy for my
passion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list above shows released projects, but I&#x27;ve also experimented (and
sometimes at two hairs of a release) with:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unikernel&quot;&gt;Unikernels&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; this one was
really fun, given a WebAssembly module and a filesystem, we were able
to generate a unikernel that was executing the given program,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parser; to write the fastest WebAssembly parser possible, it was
working, but never released,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) ABI for WebAssembly, so that we can
run WebAssembly on small chips super easily (think of IoT),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking; an extension to WASI to support networking (TCP and UDP
sockets), with an implementation in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C_standard_library&quot;&gt;libc&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and even
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zig&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;! We were able to compile C
programs to WebAssembly like cURL, or TCP servers written with kqueue
or epoll etc, and to execute them on any platforms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those things were working.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely crazy what WebAssembly can do today, and I still truly
and deeply believe in this technology. I&#x27;m not the only one:
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;YCombinator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;speedinvest&#x2F;the-next-generation-of-cloud-computing-investing-in-wasmer-768c9aac5922&quot;&gt;SpeedInvest&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
are also founders that believe in Wasmer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. What a dream, huh?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-toxic-working-environment&quot;&gt;The toxic working environment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; without its community. I won&#x27;t name people to
avoid missing important persons, but all the contributors are doing
amazing work, to create something new, something special, something
&lt;em&gt;right&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer is a success. The Wasmer runtime is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; without the
incredible, marvelous, exceptional team of engineers behind it. In no
particular order: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lachlansneff&quot;&gt;Lachlan Sneff&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MarkMcCaskey&quot;&gt;Mark McCaskey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jubianchi&quot;&gt;Julien
Bianchi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nlewycky&quot;&gt;Nick
Lewycky&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;losfair&quot;&gt;Heyang
Zhou&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xmclark&quot;&gt;Mackenzie
Clark&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bjfish&quot;&gt;Brandon
Fish&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. All of them, with no exception, have
put a lot of passion in this project. It is what it is today because of
them and also because of the contributors we have been honored to
welcome. The open source side of Wasmer was intense but also an
important source of joy. It is a respectful place to work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the inside reality was very different. All the employees
hereinabove have left the company. Almost all of them due to a burn-out
or conflicts or strong disagreements with the company leadership. I am
leaving due to a severe burn-out. I would like to briefly share my
journey to my first burn-out in few points:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#x27;ve started as an engineer. I love coding. I love hacking. In Wasmer,
I&#x27;ve found a place to learn a lot and to express my passion. We had a
lot of pressure mostly because our friendly “competitors” had more
people dedicated to work on their runtimes, more money, more power,
better marketing and so on. That&#x27;s the inevitable burden of any
startup. When you&#x27;re competing against giants, that&#x27;s what happens.
And that&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s part of the game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During that time, we were delivering more and more projects, more and
more features, at an incredible pace. New hats: Release manager,
project manager, more product ownership, more customers to be
connected with, more contributors to help, more issues to triage, blog
writer etc. The pace was accelerating too fast, something we did
notice on multiple occasions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CEO, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;syrusakbary&quot;&gt;Syrus Akbary&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, had evidently
a lot of pressure on its shoulders. It sadly resulted in the worst
possible way: micro-management, stress, pressure, bad leadership, lack
of vision, lack of trust in the employees, changing the roadmap
constantly, lies, secrets etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As one of the older in the company, with a family of two kids, I
probably got more “wisdom”. I&#x27;ve decided to create a safe place for
employees to express their frustrations, their needs, to find
solutions together. &lt;em&gt;De facto&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, I became the “person of trust” in the
company. I got new hats, new pressures.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 hit. School at home. Lock-down. More micro-management, more
stress. Wasmer was running out of money. I brought a new investor that
saved the company. New hat.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After too many departures (85% of the engineering team!), I tried to
take more space and to take more responsabilities in the company. That
was at the beginning of 2021. It was my last attempt to save the
company from a disaster before leaving. &lt;strong&gt;I couldn&#x27;t imagine leaving
such brilliant and successful projects without having tried everything
I could&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then &lt;strong&gt;I became a &lt;em&gt;late co-founder&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Too many new hats:
Doing hiring interviews, accountabilities, helping to define the
roadmap (with another awesome person, friend, and employee), handling
legal aspects to hire people in multiple countries with non-precarious
contracts etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, I was also doing the job of all the engineers that have
left. They were not replaced for unknown reasons. It was absolutely
madness. The pace was unsustainable.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the crack. The CEO continued to change the roadmap, to take
bad decisions, to not recognize all the efforts we were doing to
save&#x2F;grow the company. It was my turn to be declared in a &lt;em&gt;severe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
burn-out by my physician. The last engineer to fall.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point: Syrus Akbary also has made many public errors that have
created hostility against the company. Hopefully people were smart and
kind enough to make the difference between the employees and the CEO (I
won&#x27;t name the people but they will recognize themselves: Thank you). I
tried to fix that situation. Discussing with dozens of person to restore
empathy and forgiveness, to create better collaboration, to cure and
move forward. It was exhausting. I know people have appreciated what I
did, but my mental health was ruined.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all the time I&#x27;ve devoted to the company, the very few
consideration I got in return, the countless work hours (4 days per
week, but frequently closing the computer at 1am due to very late
meetings, I was working like hell), the precarious contract I had (did
you ever see a co-founder with a freelancer contract?), the toxic
working environment, the constant pressure etc., my passion was intact
but my motivation was seriously damaged. Doing overtime was never
recorded and was happening more than frequently, but taking half a day
to take care of a sick child was immediately counted as holidays; the
balance was broken. Criticisms. Micro-management. Disapprovals.
Rewriting the facts and the reality to criticize what you&#x27;re doing,
flipping things against you, avoiding discussion when things get stormy.
We even had a meeting titled “Why you&#x27;re not productive enough” whilst
everyone was working as hell, right after the rewrite of the entire
runtime to release Wasmer 1.0, a period we all affectionately called
“The Rewrite of Hell”. The team deserved vacations, congratulations,
attentions, gratitude, … not such a shitty meeting. Well, you get the
idea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&#x27;ve been declared in a severe burn-out, I had to take a break. The
reaction from the CEO was… unexpected: Zero empathy, asking to never
ever being sick again (otherwise I will be fired), dividing my equities,
asking me to work more, saying I&#x27;ve never been involved in the company
etc. That was the final straw to me. That&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;the&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wrong way to treat an
employee, a collaborator, a contributor, the co-founder.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;What&#x27;s next?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to recover. As you can imagine, working 2.5 years at this pace
leaves sequelae. Hopefully a couple of months should suffice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m still in love with Wasmer, the &lt;strong&gt;runtime&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, the open source projects
we have created. It has a bright future. More companies are contributing
to it, more individual contributors are bringing their stones to the
monument. The project is owned by the public, by the users, by the
contributors, they are doing most of the work today. It&#x27;s well tested,
well documented, it&#x27;s easy to contribute to it. It&#x27;s a fabulous open
source piece of technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Wasmer, the &lt;strong&gt;company&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, will change. The products
that are going to be released are absolutely fantastic. It&#x27;s a
technology shift. It will enable the Decentralized Web, how we compile
and distribute programs, how we will even consume programs. Wasmer has a
solid bright future. I really &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; things will change, and I wish the
best to and am passing on the torch to the adventurers that will
continue to move the company forward. I&#x27;m just too &lt;em&gt;skeptical&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that
things can improve or even slightly change. We have built something
great. Please take a great care of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Bye bye Automattic, hello Wasmer</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>

          <guid>https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-automattic-hello-wasmer/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-automattic-hello-wasmer/">&lt;p&gt;Today is my first day at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasmer.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s with a lot of regrets that I leave Automattic. To be clear, I&#x27;m not
leaving because something negative happened, I&#x27;m leaving because I&#x27;ve
received the same job offer, 3 times in 10 days, from Wasmer, Google and
Mozilla. Namely to work with Rust or C++ to build a WebAssembly runtime.
This is an offer I can barely decline. It&#x27;s an opportunity and a dream
for me. And I was lucky enough to get a choice between 3 excellent
companies!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only encourage you to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;automattic.com&#x2F;work-with-us&#x2F;&quot;&gt;work with
Automattic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s definitely the
best company I&#x27;ve ever work with; stealing the 1st place to Mozilla.
Automattic is not only about WordPress.com and other services: It&#x27;s a
way of living. The culture, the spirit, the interactions between people,
the mission, everything is &lt;em&gt;exceptional&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It has been a super great
experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could write 100 pages about my team. They have all been &lt;em&gt;remarkable&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
in many ways. I&#x27;m closer to them although they live at 10&#x27;000km, rather
than colleagues I met everyday in person in the past. Congrats to
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ma.tt&#x2F;about&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for this incredible project.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&#x27;s time to work on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
It&#x27;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; runtime written in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: My two current passions. It&#x27;s
powerful, modular, well-designed, and it comes with great ambitions. I&#x27;m
really exciting. I work with an extraordinary team: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;syrusakbary&quot;&gt;Syrus
Akbary&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (the author of
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphql-python&#x2F;graphene&quot;&gt;Graphene&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a GraphQL
framework in Python), &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lachlansneff&quot;&gt;Lachlan Sneff&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nebulet&#x2F;nebulet&quot;&gt;Nebulet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a
microkernel that implements a WebAssembly &quot;usermode&quot; that runs in Ring
0), &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bjfish&quot;&gt;Brandon Fish&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (a great contributor of
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oracle&#x2F;truffleruby&quot;&gt;Truffleruby&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a high performance
implementation of Ruby with GraalVM), &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xmclark&quot;&gt;Mackenzie
Clark&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and soon more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My job will consist to work on the runtime of course, and also to
integrate&#x2F;embed the runtime into different languages, such as PHP —like
I did with &lt;code&gt;[php-ext-wasm](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hywan&#x2F;php-ext-wasm)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, more
to come on this blog—. More secret projects coming. Let&#x27;s turn them into
realities 🎉!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Welcome to Chaos</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://mnt.io/articles/welcome-to-chaos/</link>
          <guid>https://mnt.io/articles/welcome-to-chaos/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://mnt.io/articles/welcome-to-chaos/">&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;bye-bye-liip-hello-automattic&#x2F;&quot;&gt;I joined
Automattic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
This is a world-wide distributed company. The first three weeks you
incarn a Happiness Engineer. This is part of the Happiness Rotation
duty. This article explains why I loved it, and why I reckon you should
do it too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;happiness-engineer-really&quot;&gt;Happiness Engineer, really?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it sound mad as a Cheshire cat? Pretentious maybe? Actually, it&#x27;s
not at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Happiness Engineer, I had to make the support. This is part of the
Happiness Rotation: Once a year, almost everyone swaps its position to
help our users. I will go back on this later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My role was to make our users happy. To achieve that, I had to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet our users, understand who they are, what they want to achieve,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to and understand their issues,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a way to fix the issues.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;meet-the-users&quot;&gt;Meet the users&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need motivations in my job. Learning who our users are, and what they
want to achieve, is a great motivation. After these three weeks, I know
what my contributions will serve. It gives a meaning to each
contribution, to each day I wake up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially in a distributed company on Internet, our users are
world-wide, they speak almost all the languages on Earth, they are
present on all continents. Their needs vary a lot, they use our
softwares in ways I was not able to foresee.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;listen-to-understand-and-fix-their-issues&quot;&gt;Listen to, understand, and fix their issues&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are chatting with a “support guy”, you cannot imagine this is a
real engineer. This is not a random person filling a pre-defined vague
form somewhere where it is cheap to hire her. You will chat with someone
very competent. Someone that has no superior. Someone that has all the
tools to make you happy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, when I started, it was the first time I was using WordPress.
I was more novice than the user I was talking to. So how to fix it on my
end? I had to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask help to the right persons,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, meet Automatticians (people working with Automattic),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover all the interactions between them,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the structure of the company,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to ask help, how to formulate my questions, how to reformulate the
issues of the users…&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover all the internal tools,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, learn how the softwares work internally and together,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover the giant internal and public documentations,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When needed, create bug reports or feature requests to the
appropriated teams,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the culture of the company.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why it is called &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Chaos&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Yes, you have to learn a
lot in three weeks, but it is extremely educative. This is like a speed
training.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;happiness&quot;&gt;Happiness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can ensure that when a user is grateful after you fixed its issue, the
term Happiness Engineer makes a lot of sense. Automattic provides a lot
of freedom to their Happiness Engineers to make people really happy,
both in term of tooling or financial.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I see a company that is that much generous with
its customers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thanks-buddy&quot;&gt;Thanks buddy&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when embracing the chaos, you are not alone. Everyone is here
to help you, and to answer your questions. After all, this is part of
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;automattic.com&#x2F;creed&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the Automattic&#x27;s creed&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ma.tt&#x2F;2011&#x2F;09&#x2F;automattic-creed&#x2F;&quot;&gt;story of the
creed&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are
assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will
build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers.
&lt;strong&gt;I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, and
&lt;strong&gt;I’ll remember the days before I knew everything&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. I am more
motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of
the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much
as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in
a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the
only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every
day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to everyone willing to help, a buddy was assigned to me. A
person that helps and teaches you everytime. This is very helpful. Thank
you Hannah!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;happiness-rotation&quot;&gt;Happiness Rotation&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience is great. But after some time, you might forget it. So
as a reminder, once a year, you incarn a Happiness Engineer again. This
is part of the happiness rotation. As far as I understand, it implies
almost everyone in the company.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Obviously, there is permanent happiness engineers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deeply think this approach has many advantages. Some of them are
listed above. It helps to understand the company, and more importantly
the users. The happiness rotation stresses the fact that users are
central to Automattic, probably like any companies, but not with this
care. Remember the creed: I will build our business sustainably through
passionate and loyal customers. To have passionate and loyal users, you
need to know them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it was a great experience. It was chaotic at first, but it is
worth it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Bye bye Liip, hello Automattic</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
          <author>Unknown</author>
          <link>https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-liip-hello-automattic/</link>
          <guid>https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-liip-hello-automattic/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-liip-hello-automattic/">&lt;p&gt;Since April 2017, I have left &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.liip.ch&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Liip&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to join
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;automattic.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;bye-bye-liip&quot;&gt;Bye bye Liip&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost 20 months at Liip, I am leaving. Liip was a great
experience. It was my first industrial non-remote job. It was also my
first job in the country I am currently living in. And I have discovered
a new way of working.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-industrial-non-remote-job&quot;&gt;First industrial non-remote job&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before working for Liip, I was working for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fruux.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;fruux&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
My situation was the following: A french citizen, living as a foreigner
in Switzerland, working for a German company, with employees from
Germany, Holland, and Canada. Everything happened on chat, mail, and
Skype. When my son was born, I had to change my work to simplify my
life. It was not the only reason, but one of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before fruux, I was working for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inria.fr&#x2F;en&#x2F;&quot;&gt;INRIA&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a
research institute in France. It was partially a remote job.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liip has several offices. I was based in Lausanne.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, Liip was my first industrial non-remote job. And I liked it.
Working in the train on the morning, walking in Lausanne, seeing real
people, everything in my local language. Because yes, it was my first
job in my native language too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was simpler. And when you have your first baby, anything else
that is simpler saves your life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-holacracy&quot;&gt;Introducing Holacracy&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant discussions were happening to remove any form of hierarchy in
Liip. Then we discovered
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Holacracy&quot;&gt;Holacracy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and we started
moving to this system. This is a new governance system. If you are
familiar with distributed network topologies in Computer Science, or
data structures, it really looks like a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hal.archives-ouvertes.fr&#x2F;hal-00560821&#x2F;document&quot;&gt;Distributed Spanning
Tree&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
[&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dblp.org&#x2F;rec&#x2F;html&#x2F;journals&#x2F;tpds&#x2F;DahanPN09&quot;&gt;DahanPN09&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;]. Note:
I am sure that the authors of Holacracy are not aware of DST, but, eh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So nothing new from a research point of view, but it is cool to see this
algorithm coming alive in real life. And it worked: Less meetings, more
self-organisation, more shared responsabilities, no more “boss” etc.
This is not a tool for all companies, but I am sure that if you are
reading my blog, then your company should give it a try.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-source-projects&quot;&gt;Open source projects&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liip has been very generous with me regarding my open source
engagements. I was involved in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoa-project.net&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Hoa&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atoum.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;atoum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FriendsOfPHP&#x2F;pickle&quot;&gt;Pickle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; when joining the
company. Liip gave me a 5% budget, so roughly 1 hour per day to work on
Hoa. Thank you for that!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I have started a new big project, called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tagua-vm&#x2F;tagua-vm&quot;&gt;Tagua
VM&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. They gave me an additional 5%
budget. So I got 2 hours per day to work on Hoa and Tagua VM. Again, thank
you for that!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have started an in-house open project called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;liip&#x2F;TheA11yMachine&quot;&gt;The A11y
Machine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (a11ym for short). I
have written a case study for this tool on the Liip&#x27;s blog:
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.liip.ch&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;06&#x2F;accessibility-with-a11ym.html&quot;&gt;Accessibility: make your website barrier-free with
a11ym!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of a11ym is to automate the accessibility testing of any site
by crawling and testing each page. A sweet report is generated, showing
all errors, warnings, and notices, with all information needed by the
developer to fix the issues as fast as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;bye-bye-liip-hello-automattic&#x2F;.&#x2F;dashboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dashboard&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dashboard of a11ym, showing the evolution of the accessibility of a site
in time&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;bye-bye-liip-hello-automattic&#x2F;.&#x2F;report.png&quot; alt=&quot;Report&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical a11ym report listing all errors, warnings, and notices for a
given URL&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has received really good feedbacks from the accessibility
community. It has been downloaded 7000 times so far, which is not bad
considering the niche it targets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new SaaS platform is being build around this software. I enjoyed
working on it, and it was really tangible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-customer-huge-project&quot;&gt;Main customer, huge project&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liip is a Web agency, so you have dozens of customers at the same time.
However, I was in a special team for an important customer. The site is
a luxury watches and jewellery e-commerce platform, located in several
countries, in 10 languages, accessible from 16 domains, shared in 2
datacenters. This is not a casual site.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot about all the complexity such a site brings: Checkout
rules (oh damned…), product catalogs in different formats for different
countries with different references, all the business logic inherent to
each country, different payment providers, crazy front end
compatibilities etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a hundred of crazy anecdotes to tell. This was clearly not a job
for me at first glance: I am a researcher, I have an open source culture
background, I am not tailored for this kind of project. But at the end
of the story, I learned a lot. Really a lot. I have a better overview of
the crazy things any customer can ask, or has to deal with, and the
infrastructure craziness that can be set up. I learned how to make
better things: How to transform a really crappy software into something
understandable by everyone, how to not break a 10+ years old progam with
no test etc. And it requires skills. I learned it the hard way, but I
learned it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-leaving&quot;&gt;Why leaving?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because even if I learned during my time at Liip, the Web agency model
was definitively not for me. I am very thankful to every Liiper, I had a
great time, I love the Web, but not in an agency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son is now 21 months old, and I need fresh air. I can take new
challenges.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;welcome-automattic&quot;&gt;Welcome Automattic&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;automattic.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the company behind
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WordPress.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;woocommerce.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WooCommerce&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akismet.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Akismet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simplenote.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Simplenote&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudup.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Cloudup&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simperium.com&quot;&gt;Simperium&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.gravatar.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Gravatar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and other giant services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to Automattic by coincidence. I was looking for a sponsor for
Tagua VM, and someone pointed me out Automattic. After some researches
about the company, it appears that it could be a really great place
where to work. So I applied.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hiring process was 4 months long. It was exhausting because it
happened at the same time than a big sprint at Liip (remember the SaaS
platform for The A11y Machine?). But after 4 months, it appears I
succeeded, and I am very glad of that fact!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am just starting my job at Automattic. I don&#x27;t have anything strong
and finite to say now, apart that everything is just awesome so far. In
few weeks, I am likely to write about my start at Automattic I did, see
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;welcome-to-chaos&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Welcome to Chaos&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. They
have a very interesting way to get you on board.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for a new adventure!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://mnt.io/articles/hello-fruux/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;leaving-the-research-world&quot;&gt;Leaving the research world&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have really enjoyed my time at INRIA and Femto-ST, 2 research
institutes in France. But after 8 years at the university and a hard PhD
thesis (but with great results by the way!), I would like to see other
things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time as an intern at Mozilla and my work in the open-source world
have been very &lt;em&gt;seductive&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Open-source contrasts a lot with the
research world, where privacy and secrecy are first-citizens of every
project. All the work I have made and all the algorithms I have
developed during my PhD thesis have been implemented under an
open-source license, and I ran into some issues because of such decision
(patents are sometimes better, sometimes not… long story).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I like research but I also like to hack and share everything. And
right now, I have to get a change of air! So I asked on Twitter:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (Ivan Enderlin, a fresh PhD, creator of Hoa) am looking for a job.
Here is my CV:
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.co&#x2F;dAdLm35RUu&quot;&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.co&#x2F;dAdLm35RUu&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Please, contact me!
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hashtag&#x2F;hoajob?src=hash&quot;&gt;#hoajob&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Hoa project (@hoaproject) &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hoaproject&#x2F;status&#x2F;492382581271572480&quot;&gt;July 24th,
2014&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what a surprise! A &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of companies answered to my tweet (most
of them in private of course), but the most interesting one at my eyes
was… fruux 😉.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fruux&quot;&gt;fruux&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fruux defines itself as: “A unified contacts&#x2F;calendaring system that
works across &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fruux.com&#x2F;supported-devices&#x2F;&quot;&gt;platforms and
devices&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We are behind
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fruux.com&#x2F;opensource&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;dav&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is the most popular
open-source implementation of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CardDAV&quot;&gt;CardDAV&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CardDAV&quot;&gt;CalDAV&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; standards. Besides us,
developers and companies around the globe use our &lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;dav&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; technology
to deliver sync functionality to millions of users”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;hello-fruux&#x2F;.&#x2F;fruux-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fruux&amp;#39;s logo&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  fruux&#x27;s logo.
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several things attract me at fruux:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low-layers are open-source,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;viable ecosystem based on open-source,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accepts remote working,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;close timezone to mine,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;touching millions of people,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;standards in minds.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point is the most important for me. I don&#x27;t want to make a
company richer without any benefits for the rest of the world. I want my
work to be beneficial to the rest of the world, to share my work, I want
my work to be reused, hacked, criticized, updated and shared again. This
is the spirit of the open-source and the hackability paradigms. And
fortunately for me, fruux&#x27;s low-layers are 100% open-source, namely
&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;dav&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; &amp;amp; co.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, being able to eat at the end of the month with open-source is
not that simple. Fortunately for me, fruux has a stable economic model,
based on open-source. Obviously, I have to work on closed projects,
obviously, I have to work for some specific customers, but I can go back
to open-source goodnesses all the time 😉.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I am currently living in Switzerland and fruux is located
in Germany. Fortunately for me, fruux&#x27;s team is kind of dispatched all
around Europe and the world. Naturally, they accept me to work remotely.
Whilst it can be inconvenient for some people, I enjoy to have my own
hours, to organize myself as I would like etc. Periodical meetings and
phone-calls help to stay focused. And I like to think that people are
more productive this way. After 4 years at home because of my Master
thesis and PhD thesis, I know how to organize myself and exchange with a
decentralized team. This is a big advantage. Moreover, Germany is in the
same timezone as Switzerland! Compared to companies located at, for
instance, California, this is simpler for my family.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, working on an open-source project that is used by millions of
users is very motivating. You know that your contributions will touch a
lot of people and it gives meaning to my work on a daily basis. Also,
the last thing I love at fruux is this desire to respect standards, RFC,
recommandations etc. They are involved in these processes, consortiums
and groups (for instance
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;calconnect.org&#x2F;mbrlist.shtml&quot;&gt;CalConnect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). I love standards and
specifications, and this methodology reminds me the scientific approach
I had with my PhD thesis. I consider that a standard without an
implementation has no meaning, and a well-designed standard is a piece
of a delicious cake, especially when everyone respects this standard 😄.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(… but the cake is a lie!)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sabre&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;*&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fruux has mostly hired me because of my experience on
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoa-project.net&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Hoa&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. One of my main public job is to work on
all the &lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;*&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; libraries, which include:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fruux&#x2F;sabre-dav&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;dav&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fruux&#x2F;sabre-davclient&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;davclient&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fruux&#x2F;sabre-event&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;event&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fruux&#x2F;sabre-http&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;http&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fruux&#x2F;sabre-proxy&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;proxy&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fruux&#x2F;sabre-tzserver&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;tzserver&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fruux&#x2F;sabre-vobject&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;vobject&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fruux&#x2F;sabre-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;xml&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find the documentations and the news on
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sabre.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;sabre.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these libraries serve the first one: &lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;dav&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, which is an
implementation of the WebDAV technology, including extensions for
CalDAV, and CardDAV, respectively for calendars, tasks and address
books. For the one who does not know what is WebDAV, in few words: The
Web is mostly a read-only media, but WebDAV extends HTTP in order to be
able to write and collaborate on documents. The way WebDAV is defined is
fascinating, and even more, the way it can be extended.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work is already done by &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;evertpot.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Evert&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
many contributors, but we can go deeper! More extensions, more
standards, better code, better algorithms etc.!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the work I am doing on &lt;code&gt;sabre&#x2F;*&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, you can
check this &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;search?q=user%3Afruux+author%3Ahywan&amp;amp;type=Issues&quot;&gt;search result on
Github&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-of-hoa&quot;&gt;Future of Hoa&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain people have asked me about the future of Hoa: Whether I am going
to stop it or not since I have a job now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, a PhD thesis is exhausting, and believe me, it requires more
energy than a regular job, even if you are passionate about your job and
you did not count working hours. With a PhD thesis, you have no weekend,
no holidays, you are always out of time, you always have a ton (sic) of
articles and documents to read… there is no break, no end. In these
conditions, I was able to maintain Hoa and to grow the project though,
thanks to a very helpful and present community!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, fruux is planning to use Hoa. I don&#x27;t know how or when, but if
at a certain moment, using Hoa makes sense, they will. What does it
imply for Hoa and me? It means that I will be paid to work on Hoa at a
little percentage. I don&#x27;t know how much, it will depend of the moments,
but this is a big step forward for the project. Moreover, a project like
fruux using Hoa is a big chance! I hope to see the fruux&#x27;s logo very
soon on the homepage of the Hoa&#x27;s website.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, to conclude, I will have more time (on evenings, weekends,
holidays and sometimes during the day) to work on Hoa. Do not be afraid,
the future is bright 😄.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bref&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, I am working at fruux!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
