Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasmer.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For those who
don&#x27;t know this name, it has a twofold meaning: it&#x27;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;very popular
WebAssembly runtime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as well as a
startup. I want to write about what I&#x27;ve been able to accomplish during
my time at Wasmer (a high overview, not a technical view), and what
&lt;em&gt;forces&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; me to leave the company despite being one of its co-founder. I
reckon my testimony can help other people to avoid digging into the hell
I (and my colleagues) had to endure. I&#x27;m available for work, you can
contact me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ivan@mnt.io&quot;&gt;ivan@mnt.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnt_io&quot;&gt;@mnt_io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;ivan-enderlin&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ivan-enderlin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (LinkedIn).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-nothing-to-pure-awesomeness&quot;&gt;From nothing to pure awesomeness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve joined the Wasmer company at its early beginning, in March 2019.
The company was 3 months old. My initial role was to write and to
improve the runtime itself, and to create many embeddings, i.e. ways to
integrate the Wasmer runtime inside various technologies, so that
WebAssembly can run everywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say with confidence that my work is a success. I&#x27;ve learned a lot,
and I&#x27;ve worked on so many different projects, technologies, hacked so
many things, collaborated with so many people, every action was led by
the &lt;strong&gt;passion&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, Wasmer has an incredible growth. In 2.5 years
only, the runtime has more than 10&#x27;500 stars on Github, and is &lt;strong&gt;one of
the most popular WebAssembly runtime in the world&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;! It&#x27;s used by many
various companies, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;confio.tech&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Confio&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluence.network&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Fluence
Labs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hotg.dev&#x2F;&quot;&gt;HOT-G&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Brave&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Google&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacemesh.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;SpaceMesh&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkerd.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Linkerd&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.singlestore.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;SingleStore&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clever-cloud.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CleverCloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;konghq.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kong&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to name a few (for the ones I can name
though, however other companies are also using Wasmer in very critical
environments).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my engineering job happened on the Wasmer runtime itself. At the
time of writing, I&#x27;m the #2 contributor on the project. I was working
on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;f9ff574e10d4ee97f836565bdae99035e04ac879&#x2F;lib&quot;&gt;every parts of the
runtime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:
the API, the C API, the compilers, the ABI (mostly WASI), the engines,
the middlewares, and the VM itself which is the most low-level
foundamental layer of the runtime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The runtime provides so many features. It is an impressively powerful
runtime for WebAssembly, and I&#x27;m saying that with a neutral and
respectful mindset. Not everything is perfect obviously but I did my
best to set up a truly user-friendly learning environment, with an
important documentation and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;f9ff574e10d4ee97f836565bdae99035e04ac879&#x2F;examples&quot;&gt;a collection of
examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
that illustrate many features. I strongly believe it contributed to
Wasmer&#x27;s popularity to great extent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to highlight the most notable embedding projects I&#x27;ve
created:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;c-api&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is
the C embedding for Wasmer. It&#x27;s part of the Wasmer runtime itself, and is
fully written in Rust.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;wasmer-c-api&#x2F;*&#x2F;wasmer_c_api&#x2F;wasm_c_api&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;The documentation, the C
examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
everything is super polished to offer the best experience possible. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MarkMcCaskey&quot;&gt;Mark
McCaskey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and I are the authors of this
project.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-python&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the Python
embedding for Wasmer. At the time of writing, it&#x27;s been installed more than 5
millions times (I&#x27;m counting the compiler packages too, like
&lt;code&gt;wasmer-compiler-cranelift&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and so on), and 1300 stars on Github. There is
about 300&#x27;000 downloads per months, and it continues to grow! The code is
written in Rust, and it relies on
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyo3.rs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the awesome &lt;code&gt;pyo3&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; .&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-go&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-go&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the Go embedding for
Wasmer. It&#x27;s hard to know how much total downloads we have because of how the
Go ecosystem is designed, but we have about 60&#x27;000 downloads per months from
Github (I&#x27;m excluding the forks of the project), and 1600 stars on Github. The
code is written in Go and uses &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;cmd&#x2F;cgo&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cgo&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to bind
against the C API. Almost all blockchain projects that use WebAssembly are
using &lt;code&gt;wasmer-go&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, which is a popularity I wasn&#x27;t expecting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-ruby&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-ruby&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the Ruby
embedding for Wasmer. It&#x27;s not as popular as the others, but it&#x27;s also very
polished and it&#x27;s finding its place in the Ruby ecosystem. The code is written
in Rust, and it relies on
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danielpclark&#x2F;rutie&quot;&gt;the awesome &lt;code&gt;rutie&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; .&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I won&#x27;t detail all the projects, but there is also
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-php&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-java&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer-postgres&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-postgres&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;… Because of
the Wasmer runtime API and C API we have designed, many developers around the
globe have been able to create a lot more embeddings, such as in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;migueldeicaza&#x2F;WasmerSharp&quot;&gt;C#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chances&#x2F;wasmer-d&quot;&gt;D&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tessi&#x2F;wasmex&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dirkschumacher&#x2F;wasmr&quot;&gt;R&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AlwaysRightInstitute&#x2F;SwiftyWasmer&quot;&gt;Swift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zigwasm&#x2F;wasmer-zig&quot;&gt;Zig&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dart-lang&#x2F;wasm&quot;&gt;Dart&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;helmutkian&#x2F;cl-wasm-runtime&quot;&gt;Lisp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and so on.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other fun notable projects are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;sonde-rs&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sonde-rs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a library to
compile USDT probes into a Rust library,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;llvm-custom-builds&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;llvm-custom-builds&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a
sandbox to produce custom LLVM builds for various platforms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;loupe&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;loupe&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a set of tools to
analyse and to profile Rust code,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;interface-types&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmer-interface-types&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a
“living” (understand an unstable playground) library that implements
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;interface-types&quot;&gt;the WebAssembly Interface Types proposal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hywan&#x2F;inline-c-rs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;inline-c-rs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, to write and
to execute C code inside Rust,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in-memory filesystem, that acts exactly like &lt;code&gt;std::fs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might think, I&#x27;ve learned so much. The impostor syndrom was very
present because I was constantly trying to do something I didn&#x27;t know.
It&#x27;s part of the routine at Wasmer: Trying something for the first time.
But it&#x27;s also what kept me motivated, and it was the energy for my
passion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list above shows released projects, but I&#x27;ve also experimented (and
sometimes at two hairs of a release) with:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unikernel&quot;&gt;Unikernels&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; this one was really
fun, given a WebAssembly module and a filesystem, we were able to generate a
unikernel that was executing the given program,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parser; to write the fastest WebAssembly parser possible, it was working, but
never released,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) ABI for WebAssembly, so that we can run
WebAssembly on small chips super easily (think of IoT),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking; an extension to WASI to support networking (TCP and UDP sockets),
with an implementation in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C_standard_library&quot;&gt;libc&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and even
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ziglang&#x2F;zig&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zig&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;! We were able to compile C programs to
WebAssembly like cURL, or TCP servers written with kqueue or epoll etc, and to
execute them on any platforms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those things were working.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely crazy what WebAssembly can do today, and I still truly
and deeply believe in this technology. I&#x27;m not the only one:
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;YCombinator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;speedinvest&#x2F;the-next-generation-of-cloud-computing-investing-in-wasmer-768c9aac5922&quot;&gt;SpeedInvest&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
are also founders that believe in Wasmer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. What a dream, huh?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-toxic-working-environment&quot;&gt;The toxic working environment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; without its community. I won&#x27;t name people to
avoid missing important persons, but all the contributors are doing
amazing work, to create something new, something special, something
&lt;em&gt;right&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer is a success. The Wasmer runtime is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; without the
incredible, marvelous, exceptional team of engineers behind it. In no
particular order: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lachlansneff&quot;&gt;Lachlan Sneff&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MarkMcCaskey&quot;&gt;Mark McCaskey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jubianchi&quot;&gt;Julien
Bianchi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nlewycky&quot;&gt;Nick
Lewycky&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;losfair&quot;&gt;Heyang
Zhou&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xmclark&quot;&gt;Mackenzie
Clark&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bjfish&quot;&gt;Brandon
Fish&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. All of them, with no exception, have
put a lot of passion in this project. It is what it is today because of
them and also because of the contributors we have been honored to
welcome. The open source side of Wasmer was intense but also an
important source of joy. It is a respectful place to work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the inside reality was very different. All the employees
hereinabove have left the company. Almost all of them due to a burn-out
or conflicts or strong disagreements with the company leadership. I am
leaving due to a severe burn-out. I would like to briefly share my
journey to my first burn-out in few points:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#x27;ve started as an engineer. I love coding. I love hacking. In Wasmer, I&#x27;ve
found a place to learn a lot and to express my passion. We had a lot of
pressure mostly because our friendly “competitors” had more people dedicated
to work on their runtimes, more money, more power, better marketing and so on.
That&#x27;s the inevitable burden of any startup. When you&#x27;re competing against
giants, that&#x27;s what happens. And that&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s part of the game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During that time, we were delivering more and more projects, more and more
features, at an incredible pace. New hats: Release manager, project manager,
more product ownership, more customers to be connected with, more contributors
to help, more issues to triage, blog writer etc. The pace was accelerating too
fast, something we did notice on multiple occasions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CEO, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;syrusakbary&quot;&gt;Syrus Akbary&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, had evidently a lot
of pressure on its shoulders. It sadly resulted in the worst possible way:
micro-management, stress, pressure, bad leadership, lack of vision, lack of
trust in the employees, changing the roadmap constantly, lies, secrets etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As one of the older in the company, with a family of two kids, I probably got
more “wisdom”. I&#x27;ve decided to create a safe place for employees to express
their frustrations, their needs, to find solutions together. &lt;em&gt;De facto&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, I
became the “person of trust” in the company. I got new hats, new pressures.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 hit. School at home. Lock-down. More micro-management, more stress.
Wasmer was running out of money. I brought a new investor that saved the
company. New hat.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After too many departures (85% of the engineering team!), I tried to take more
space and to take more responsabilities in the company. That was at the
beginning of 2021. It was my last attempt to save the company from a disaster
before leaving. &lt;strong&gt;I couldn&#x27;t imagine leaving such brilliant and successful
projects without having tried everything I could&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then &lt;strong&gt;I became a &lt;em&gt;late co-founder&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Too many new hats: Doing
hiring interviews, accountabilities, helping to define the roadmap (with
another awesome person, friend, and employee), handling legal aspects to hire
people in multiple countries with non-precarious contracts etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, I was also doing the job of all the engineers that have left. They
were not replaced for unknown reasons. It was absolutely madness. The pace was
unsustainable.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the crack. The CEO continued to change the roadmap, to take bad
decisions, to not recognize all the efforts we were doing to save&#x2F;grow the
company. It was my turn to be declared in a &lt;em&gt;severe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; burn-out by my physician.
The last engineer to fall.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point: Syrus Akbary also has made many public errors that have
created hostility against the company. Hopefully people were smart and
kind enough to make the difference between the employees and the CEO (I
won&#x27;t name the people but they will recognize themselves: Thank you). I
tried to fix that situation. Discussing with dozens of person to restore
empathy and forgiveness, to create better collaboration, to cure and
move forward. It was exhausting. I know people have appreciated what I
did, but my mental health was ruined.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all the time I&#x27;ve devoted to the company, the very few
consideration I got in return, the countless work hours (4 days per
week, but frequently closing the computer at 1am due to very late
meetings, I was working like hell), the precarious contract I had (did
you ever see a co-founder with a freelancer contract?), the toxic
working environment, the constant pressure etc., my passion was intact
but my motivation was seriously damaged. Doing overtime was never
recorded and was happening more than frequently, but taking half a day
to take care of a sick child was immediately counted as holidays; the
balance was broken. Criticisms. Micro-management. Disapprovals.
Rewriting the facts and the reality to criticize what you&#x27;re doing,
flipping things against you, avoiding discussion when things get stormy.
We even had a meeting titled “Why you&#x27;re not productive enough” whilst
everyone was working as hell, right after the rewrite of the entire
runtime to release Wasmer 1.0, a period we all affectionately called
“The Rewrite of Hell”. The team deserved vacations, congratulations,
attentions, gratitude, … not such a shitty meeting. Well, you get the
idea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&#x27;ve been declared in a severe burn-out, I had to take a break. The
reaction from the CEO was… unexpected: Zero empathy, asking to never
ever being sick again (otherwise I will be fired), dividing my equities,
asking me to work more, saying I&#x27;ve never been involved in the company
etc. That was the final straw to me. That&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;the&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wrong way to treat an
employee, a collaborator, a contributor, the co-founder.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-next&quot;&gt;What&#x27;s next?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to recover. As you can imagine, working 2.5 years at this pace
leaves sequelae. Hopefully a couple of months should suffice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m still in love with Wasmer, the &lt;strong&gt;runtime&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, the open source projects
we have created. It has a bright future. More companies are contributing
to it, more individual contributors are bringing their stones to the
monument. The project is owned by the public, by the users, by the
contributors, they are doing most of the work today. It&#x27;s well tested,
well documented, it&#x27;s easy to contribute to it. It&#x27;s a fabulous open
source piece of technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Wasmer, the &lt;strong&gt;company&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, will change. The products
that are going to be released are absolutely fantastic. It&#x27;s a
technology shift. It will enable the Decentralized Web, how we compile
and distribute programs, how we will even consume programs. Wasmer has a
solid bright future. I really &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; things will change, and I wish the
best to and am passing on the torch to the adventurers that will
continue to move the company forward. I&#x27;m just too &lt;em&gt;skeptical&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that
things can improve or even slightly change. We have built something
great. Please take a great care of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a portable binary format.
That means the same file can run anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uphold this bold statement, each language, platform and system must
be able to run WebAssembly — as fast and safely as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are familiar with Wasmer are used to this kind of
announcement! Wasmer is written in Rust, and comes with an additional
native C API. But you can use it in a lot of other languages. After
having announced libraries to use Wasmer, and thus WebAssembly, in:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…we are jazzed to announce that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;Wasmer has now landed in
Java&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s discover the Wasmer JNI library together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wasmer JNI (&lt;em&gt;Java Native Interface&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) library is based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer
runtime&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is written in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and is compiled to a shared library.
For your convenience, we produce one JAR (&lt;em&gt;Java Archive&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) per
architecture and platform. By now, the following are supported,
consistently tested, and pre-packaged (available in
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bintray.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;wasmer-jni&#x2F;wasmer-jni&quot;&gt;Bintray&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;releases&quot;&gt;Github
Releases&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;amd64-darwin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for macOS, x86 64bits,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;amd64-linux&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for Linux, x86 64 bits,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;amd64-windows&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for Windows, x86 64 bits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More architectures and more platforms will be added in the near future.
If you need a specific one, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;issues&#x2F;new?assignees=&amp;amp;labels=%F0%9F%8E%89+enhancement&amp;amp;template=---feature-request.md&amp;amp;title=&quot;&gt;feel free to
ask&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!
However, it is possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm#development&quot;&gt;produce your own JAR for your own platform
and
architecture&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JAR files are named as follows:
&lt;code&gt;wasmer-jni-$(architecture)-$(os)-$(version).jar&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Thus, to include
Wasmer JNI as a dependency of your project (assuming you use
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gradle.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Gradle&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), write for instance:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;language-text z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;dependencies {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;    implementation &amp;quot;org.wasmer:wasmer-jni-amd64-linux:0.2.0&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-plain&quot;&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAR are hosted on the Bintray&#x2F;JCenter repository under the
&lt;code&gt;[wasmer-jni](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bintray.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;wasmer-jni&#x2F;wasmer-jni)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
project. They are also attached to our &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;releases&quot;&gt;Github releases as
assets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;calling-a-webassembly-function-from-java&quot;&gt;Calling a WebAssembly function from Java&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, let’s start with a simple Rust program that we will compile to
WebAssembly, and then execute from Java.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;rust&quot; class=&quot;language-rust z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot; data-lang=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;no_mangle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-modifier z-rust&quot;&gt;pub&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-other z-rust&quot;&gt;extern&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;fn&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-entity z-name z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-rust&quot;&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-rust&quot;&gt;y&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-return-type z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-block z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;    x &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-arithmetic z-rust&quot;&gt;+&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; y
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-block z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;}&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After compilation to WebAssembly, we get a file like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;raw&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;simple.wasm&quot;&gt;this
one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
named &lt;code&gt;simple.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Java program executes the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; exported function by
passing &lt;code&gt;5&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;37&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as arguments:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;language-java z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-import z-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-control z-import z-java&quot;&gt;import&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-path z-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-support z-type z-package z-java&quot;&gt;org&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-path z-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-accessor z-dot z-java&quot;&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-support z-type z-package z-java&quot;&gt;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-accessor z-dot z-java&quot;&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-support z-class z-import z-java&quot;&gt;Instance&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-terminator z-java&quot;&gt;;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! We have successfully executed a Rust program, compiled to
WebAssembly, in Java. As you can see, it is pretty straightforward. The
API is very similar to the standard JavaScript API, or the other API we
have designed for PHP, Python, Go, Ruby etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assiduous reader might have noticed the &lt;code&gt;[0]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;.apply(5, 37)[0]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
pattern. A WebAssembly function can return zero to many values, and in
this case, we are reading the first one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Java values passed to WebAssembly exported functions are
automatically downcasted to WebAssembly values. Types are inferred at
runtime, and casting is done automatically. Thus, a WebAssembly
function acts as any regular Java function.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, an exported function is a &lt;em&gt;functional interface&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as defined
by the Java Language Specification (i.e. it is a
&lt;code&gt;[FunctionalInterface](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;8&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;lang&#x2F;FunctionalInterface.html)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;).
Thus, it is possible to write the following code where &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is an
actual function (of kind &lt;code&gt;org.wasmer.exports.Function&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a WebAssembly module not only exports functions, it also exports
memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-the-memory&quot;&gt;Reading the memory&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WebAssembly instance has one or more linear memories, a contiguous and
byte-addressable range of memory spanning from offset 0 and extending up
to a varying memory size, represented by the &lt;code&gt;org.wasmer.Memory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; class.
Let’s see how to use it. Consider the following Rust program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;rust&quot; class=&quot;language-rust z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot; data-lang=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;no_mangle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;return_hello&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function returns a pointer to the statically
allocated string. The string exists in the linear memory of the
WebAssembly module. It is then possible to read it in Java:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the &lt;code&gt;Memory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; API provides a &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method. It returns a
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;8&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;nio&#x2F;ByteBuffer.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;direct&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; byte
buffer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(of kind &lt;code&gt;java.nio.ByteBuffer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) view of the memory. It’s a standard API
for any Java developer. We think it’s best to not reinvent the wheel and
use standard API as much as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WebAssembly memory is dissociated from the JVM memory, and thus from
the garbage collector.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;GreetExample.java&quot;&gt;the Greet

&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-documentation&quot;&gt;More documentation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project comes with a &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;make javadoc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; command will
generate a traditional local Javadoc for you, in the
&lt;code&gt;build&#x2F;docs&#x2F;javadoc&#x2F;index.html&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the project’s &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file has an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm#api-of-the-wasmer-library&quot;&gt;API of
the &lt;code&gt;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; library
Section&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project comes with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&quot;&gt;a set of
examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Use the &lt;code&gt;make run-example EXAMPLE=Simple&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to run the
&lt;code&gt;SimpleExample.java&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; example for instance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly aims at being safe, but also fast. Since Wasmer JNI is the
&lt;em&gt;first&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Java library to execute WebAssembly, we can’t compare to prior
works in the Java ecosystem. However, you might know that Wasmer comes
with 3 backends: Singlepass, Cranelift and LLVM. We’ve even written an
article about it: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;a-webassembly-compiler-tale-9ef37aa3b537&quot;&gt;A WebAssembly Compiler
tale&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The Wasmer JNI library uses the Cranelift backend for the moment, which
offers the best compromise between compilation-time and execution-time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;Credits&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asami (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;d0iasm&quot;&gt;d0iasm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Twitter) has improved
this project during its internship at Wasmer under my guidance. She
finished the internship before the release of the Wasmer JNI project,
but she deserves credits for pushing the project forward! Good work
Asami!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity to remind everyone that we hire anywhere in the
world. Asami was working from Japan while I am working from Switzerland,
and the rest of the team is from US, Spain, China etc. Feel free to
contact me (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnt_io&quot;&gt;@mnt_io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;syrusakbary&quot;&gt;@syrusakbary&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Twitter) if you want
to join us on this big adventure!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer JNI is a library to execute WebAssembly directly in Java. It
embeds the WebAssembly runtime
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The first releases provide
the core API with &lt;code&gt;Module&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Instance&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Memory&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. It comes
pre-packaged as a JAR, one per architecture and per platform.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is open and hosted on Github at
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;wasmerio&#x2F;java-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
We are constantly improving the project, so if you have feedback,
issues, or feature requests please open an issue in the repository, or
reach us on Twitter at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;wasmerio&quot;&gt;@wasmerio&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnt_io&quot;&gt;@mnt_io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to see what you build with this!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is a portable binary format. That means the same program can
run anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uphold this bold statement, each language, platform and system must
be able to run WebAssembly — as fast and safely as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say it again. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a
WebAssembly runtime. We have successfully embedded the runtime in other
languages:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Rust, as it is written in Rust&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;runtime-c-api&quot;&gt;C and C++
bindings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In PHP, using

&lt;p&gt;The community has also embedded Wasmer in awesome projects:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.NET&#x2F;C#, using
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;migueldeicaza&#x2F;WasmerSharp&quot;&gt;WasmerSharp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is now time to continue the story and to hang around…
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Postgres&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so happy to announce a newcrazy idea: &lt;strong&gt;WebAssembly on
Postgres&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Yes, you read that correctly. On
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;postgres-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;Postgres&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;calling-a-webassembly-function-from-postgres&quot;&gt;Calling a WebAssembly function from Postgres&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, we have to go through the installation process. There is no
package manager for Postgres, so it’s a manual step. The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;postgres-ext-wasm#installation&quot;&gt;Installation

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the extension is installed, activated and initialized, we can start
having fun!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current API is rather small, however basic features are available.
The goal is to gather a community and to design a pragmatic API
together, discover the expectations, how developers would use this new
technology inside a database engine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how it works. To instantiate a WebAssembly module, we use the
&lt;code&gt;wasm_new_instance&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function. It takes 2 arguments: The absolute path to
the WebAssembly module, and a prefix for the module exported functions.
Indeed, if a module exports a function named &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, then a Postgres
function named &lt;code&gt;prefix_sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; calling the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function will be created
dynamically.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see it in action. Let’s start by editing a Rust program that
compiles to WebAssembly:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;rust&quot; class=&quot;language-rust z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot; data-lang=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;no_mangle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-modifier z-rust&quot;&gt;pub&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-other z-rust&quot;&gt;extern&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;fn&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-entity z-name z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-rust&quot;&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-rust&quot;&gt;y&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-return-type z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-separator z-rust&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-type z-rust&quot;&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-block z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;    x &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-arithmetic z-rust&quot;&gt;+&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; y

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this file compiled to &lt;code&gt;simple.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, we can instantiate the module,
and call the exported &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Et voilà !&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; The &lt;code&gt;ns_sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function calls the Rust &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function through
WebAssembly! How fun is that 😄?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;inspect-a-webassembly-instance&quot;&gt;Inspect a WebAssembly instance&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section shows how to inspect a WebAssembly instance. At the same
time, it quickly explains how the extension works under the hood.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension provides two foreign data wrappers, gathered together in
the &lt;code&gt;wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; foreign schema:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasm.instances&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a table with the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wasm_file&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; columns,
respectively for the unique instance ID, and the path of the WebAssembly
module,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasm.exported_functions&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a table with the &lt;code&gt;instance_id&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;name&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;inputs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;outputs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; columns, respectively for the instance ID of the
exported function, its name, its input types (already formatted for Postgres),
and its output types (already formatted for Postgres).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sql&quot; class=&quot;language-sql z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-double-dash z-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-sql&quot;&gt;--&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; Select all WebAssembly instances.

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these information, the &lt;code&gt;wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; Postgres extension is able to
generate the SQL function to call the WebAssembly exported functions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds simplistic, and… to be honest, it is! The trick is to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;fdwhandler.html&quot;&gt;foreign data
wrappers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
which is an awesome feature of Postgres.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-fast-is-it-or-is-it-an-interesting-alternative-to-pl-pgsql&quot;&gt;How fast is it, or: Is it an interesting alternative to PL&#x2F;pgSQL?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said, the extension API is rather small for now. The idea is to
explore, to experiment, to have fun with WebAssembly inside a database.
It is particularly interesting in two cases:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To write extensions or procedures with any languages that compile to
WebAssembly in place of
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;10&#x2F;plpgsql.html&quot;&gt;PL&#x2F;pgSQL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To remove a potential performance bottleneck where speed is
involved.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we run a basic benchmark. Like most of the benchmarks out there, it
must be taken with a grain of salt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to compare the execution time between WebAssembly and
PL&#x2F;pgSQL, and see how both approaches scale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Postgres WebAssembly extension uses
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;fdwhandler.html&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the
runtime, compiled with the Cranelift backend (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;a-webassembly-compiler-tale-9ef37aa3b537&quot;&gt;learn more about the
different
backends&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
We run the benchmark with Postgres 10, on a MacBook Pro 15&quot; from 2016,
2.9Ghz Core i7 with 16Gb of memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methodology is the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load both the &lt;code&gt;plpgsql_fibonacci&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;wasm_fibonacci&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; functions,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run them with a query like
&lt;code&gt;SELECT *_fibonacci(n) FROM generate_series(1, 1000)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; has the
following values: 50, 500, and 5000, so that we can observe how both
approaches scale,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the timings down,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run this methodology multiple times, and compute the median of the
results.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here come the results. The lower, the better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;announcing-the-first-postgres-extension-to-run-webassembly&#x2F;.&#x2F;benchmarks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Benchmarks&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing WebAssembly vs. PL&#x2F;pgSQL when computing the Fibonacci sequence
with n=50, 500 and 5000.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We notice that the Postgres WebAssembly extension is faster to run
numeric computations. The WebAssembly approach scales pretty well
compared to the PL&#x2F;pgSQL approach, &lt;em&gt;in this situation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-to-use-the-webassembly-extension&quot;&gt;When to use the WebAssembly extension?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the extension only supports integers (on 32- and 64-bits). The
extension doesn’t support strings &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It also doesn’t support
records, views or other Postgres types. Keep in mind this is the very
first step.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, it is too soon to tell whether WebAssembly can be an alternative
to PL&#x2F;pgSQL. But regarding the benchmark results above, we are sure they
can live side-by-side, WebAssembly has clearly a place in the ecosystem!
And we want to continue to pursue this exploration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are already talking with people that are interested in using
WebAssembly inside databases. If you have any particular use cases,

&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is a portable binary format. That means the same file can
run anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uphold this bold statement, each language, platform and system must
be able to run WebAssembly — as fast and safely as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a WebAssembly runtime
written in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It goes without saying
that the runtime can be used in any Rust application. We have also
successfully embedded the runtime in other languages:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

🐹!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are super happy to announce &lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;,
a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;Go library to run WebAssembly binaries,
fast&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;calling-a-webassembly-function-from-go&quot;&gt;Calling a WebAssembly function from Go&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s install &lt;code&gt;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in your go environment (&lt;em&gt;with cgo
support&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; class=&quot;language-sh z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-modifier z-shell&quot;&gt;export&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-other z-readwrite z-assignment z-shell&quot;&gt;CGO_ENABLED&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-shell&quot;&gt;=&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-string z-unquoted z-shell&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-logical z-continue z-shell&quot;&gt;;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-storage z-modifier z-shell&quot;&gt;export&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-other z-readwrite z-assignment z-shell&quot;&gt;CC&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-shell&quot;&gt;=&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-string z-unquoted z-shell&quot;&gt;gcc&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-logical z-continue z-shell&quot;&gt;;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;go&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell&quot;&gt; install github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump immediately into some
examples.&lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is a regular Go
library. The installation is automated with
&lt;code&gt;import &quot;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get our hands dirty. We will write a program that compiles to
WebAssembly easily, using Rust for instance:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! We have successfully executed a WebAssembly file inside Go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Go values passed to the WebAssembly exported function are
automatically cast to WebAssembly values. Types are inferred and
casting is done automatically. Thus, a WebAssembly function acts as
any regular Go function.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;webassembly-calling-go-funtions&quot;&gt;WebAssembly calling Go funtions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WebAssembly module &lt;em&gt;exports&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; some functions, so that they can be
called from the outside world. This is the entry point to execute
WebAssembly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, a WebAssembly module can also have &lt;em&gt;imported&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; functions.

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exported function &lt;code&gt;add1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; calls the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function. Its
implementation is absent, only its signature is defined. This is an
“extern function”, and for WebAssembly, this is an &lt;em&gt;imported&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; function,
because its implementation must be &lt;em&gt;imported&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s implement the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function in Go! To do so, &lt;em&gt;need&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.golang.org&#x2F;c-go-cgo&quot;&gt;cgo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function signature is defined in C (see the comment above
&lt;code&gt;import &quot;C&quot;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;),&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; implementation is defined in Go. Notice the &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F;export&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which is
the way cgo uses to map Go code to C code,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;NewImports&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is an API used to create WebAssembly imports. In this code
&lt;code&gt;&quot;sum&quot;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the WebAssembly imported function name, &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the Go function
pointer, and &lt;code&gt;C.sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the cgo function pointer,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;NewInstanceWithImports&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the constructor to use to instantiate
the WebAssembly module with imports. That’s it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the complete program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;return_hello&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function returns a pointer as an &lt;code&gt;i32&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; value. We get
its value by calling &lt;code&gt;ToI32&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Then, we fetch the memory data with
&lt;code&gt;instance.Memory.Data()&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function returns a slice over the WebAssembly instance memory. It
can be used as any regular Go slice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for us, we already know the length of the string we want to
read, so &lt;code&gt;memory[pointer : pointer+13]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is enough to read the bytes,
that are then cast to a string. &lt;em&gt;Et voilà !&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;benchmarks&quot;&gt;Benchmarks&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; has a nice API, but
…&lt;em&gt;is it fast&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to PHP or Ruby, there are already existing runtimes in the Go
world to execute WebAssembly. The main candidates are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;perlin-network&#x2F;life&quot;&gt;Life&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, from Perlin Network, a
WebAssembly interpreter&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-interpreter&#x2F;wagon&quot;&gt;Wagon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, from Go Interpreter,
a WebAssembly interpreter and toolkit.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;php-ext-wasm-migrating-from-wasmi-to-wasmer-4d1014f41c88&quot;&gt;our blog post about the PHP
extension&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
we have used &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;description&#x2F;nbody.html&quot;&gt;the n-body
algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
to benchmark the performance. Life provides more benchmarks: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fibonacci_number&quot;&gt;the
Fibonacci algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(the recursive version), &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm&quot;&gt;the Pollard’s rho
algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
the Snappy Compress operation. The latter works successfully with
&lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; but not with Life or Wagon. We
have removed it from the benchmark suites. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;benchmarks&quot;&gt;Benchmark
sources&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
are online.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Life 20190521143330–57f3819c2df0, and Wagon 0.4.0, i.e. &lt;em&gt;the
latest versions to date&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark numbers represent the average result for 10 runs each. The
computer that ran these benchmarks is a MacBook Pro 15&quot; from 2016,
2.9Ghz Core i7 with 16Gb of memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results are grouped by benchmark algorithm on the X axis. The Y axis
represents the time used to run the algorithm, expressed in
milliseconds. The lower, the better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnt.io&#x2F;articles&#x2F;announcing-the-fastest-webassembly-runtime-for-go-wasmer&#x2F;.&#x2F;benchmarks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Benchmarks&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed comparison between Wasmer, Wagon and Life. Benchmark suites are
the n-body, Fibonacci, and Pollard’s rho algorithms. Speed is expressed
in ms. Lower is better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both Life and Wagon provide on average the same speed, Wasmer
(&lt;code&gt;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext&#x2F;wasmer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) is on average &lt;strong&gt;72 times faster&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
🎉.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to know that Wasmer comes with 3 backends:
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;singlepass-backend&quot;&gt;Singlepass&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;clif-backend&quot;&gt;Cranelift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;llvm-backend&quot;&gt;LLVM&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The default backend that is used by the Go library is Cranelift (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CraneStation&#x2F;cranelift&quot;&gt;learn
more about Cranelift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). Using
LLVM will provide performance close to native, but we decided to start
with Cranelift as it offers the best tradeoff between compilation-time
and execution-time (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;a-webassembly-compiler-tale-9ef37aa3b537&quot;&gt;learn more about the different
backends&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
when to use them, pros and cons etc.).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&#x2F;wasmer](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
is a new Go library to execute WebAssembly binaries. It embeds the
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; runtime. The first version
supports all the required API for the most common usages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current benchmarks (a mix from our benchmark suites and from Life
suites) show that &lt;strong&gt;Wasmer is — on average — 72 times faster than Life
and Wagon&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, the two major existing WebAssembly runtimes in the Go
world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow the development, take a look at
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;wasmerio&quot;&gt;@wasmerio&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnt_io&quot;&gt;@mnt_io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Twitter, or

Mastodon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, everything is open source at
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;wasmerio&#x2F;go-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time, we can’t wait to see what you build with us!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://mnt.io/articles/elephant-crab-spider-web-php-ext-wasm-migrating-from-wasmi-to-wasmer/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;php-ext-wasm-migrating-from-wasmi-to-wasmer-4d1014f41c88&quot;&gt;an article I wrote for
Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First as a joke, now as a real product, I started to develop
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;php-ext-wasm&quot;&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: a
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;php.net&#x2F;&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; extension allowing to execute
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; binaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PHP virtual machine (VM) is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;php&#x2F;php-src&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zend
Engine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. To write an extension, one
needs to develop in C or C++. The extension was simple C bindings to a
Rust library I also wrote. At that time, this Rust library was using
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paritytech&#x2F;wasmi&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the WebAssembly VM. I
knew that &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; wasn’t the fastest WebAssembly VM in the game, but the
API is solid, well-tested, it compiles quickly, and is easy to hack. All
the requirements to start a project!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 6 hours of development, I got something working. I was able to run
the following PHP program:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;php&quot; class=&quot;language-php z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-embedding z-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-text z-html z-basic&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-embedded z-block z-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-embedded z-begin z-php&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-embedded z-block z-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-php&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API is straightforward: create an instance (here of &lt;code&gt;simple.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;),
then call functions on it (here &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with 1 and 2 as arguments). PHP
values are transformed into WebAssembly values automatically. For the
record, here is the &lt;code&gt;simple.rs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; Rust program that is compiled to a
WebAssembly binary:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;rust&quot; class=&quot;language-rust z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot; data-lang=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-begin z-rust&quot;&gt;[&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-annotation z-rust&quot;&gt;no_mangle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-group z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-block z-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-section z-block z-end z-rust&quot;&gt;}&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was great! 6 hours is a relatively small number of hours to go that
far according to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I quickly noticed that &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is… slow. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;One of the promise of
WebAssembly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webassembly.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;portability&#x2F;#assumptions-for-efficient-execution&quot;&gt;common hardware
capabilities&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
available on a wide range of platforms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And clearly, my extension wasn’t fulfilling this promise. Let’s see a
basic comparison with a benchmark.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;description&#x2F;nbody.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;n-body&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the Computer Language Benchmarks
Game&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from
Debian, mostly because it’s relatively CPU intensive. Also, the
algorithm has a simple interface: based on an integer, it returns a
floating-point number; this API doesn’t involve any advanced instance
memory API, which is perfect to test a proof-of-concept.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a baseline, I’ve run the &lt;em&gt;n-body&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; algorithm &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;program&#x2F;nbody-rust-7.html&quot;&gt;written in
Rust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
let’s call it &lt;code&gt;rust-baseline&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The same algorithm has been &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;program&#x2F;nbody-php-3.html&quot;&gt;written in
PHP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
let’s call it &lt;code&gt;php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Finally, the algorithm has been compiled from Rust
to WebAssembly, and executed with the &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; extension, let’s
call that case &lt;code&gt;php+wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. All results are for &lt;code&gt;nbody(5000000)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rust-baseline&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 287ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 19,761ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php+wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 67,622ms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so… &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;3.4 times slower&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than PHP
itself, it is pointless to use WebAssembly in such conditions!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It confirms my first intuition though: In our case, &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is really
great to mock something up, but it’s not fast enough for our
expectations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;faster-faster-faster&quot;&gt;Faster, faster, faster…&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CraneStation&#x2F;cranelift&quot;&gt;Cranelift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
since the beginning. It’s a code generator, &lt;em&gt;à la&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;llvm.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;LLVM&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (excuse the brutal shortcut, the goal isn’t to
explain what Cranelift is in details, but that’s a really awesome
project!). To quote the project itself:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranelift is a low-level retargetable code generator. It translates a
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cranelift.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ir.html&quot;&gt;target-independent intermediate
representation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
into executable machine code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It basically means that the Cranelift API can be used to generate
executable code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s perfect! I can replace &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; by Cranelift, and boom, profit. But…
there is other ways to get even faster code execution — at the cost of a
longer code compilation though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, LLVM can provide a very fast code execution, almost at
native speed. Or we can generate assembly code dynamically. Well, there
is multiple ways to achieve that. What if a project could provide a
WebAssembly virtual machine with multiple backends?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-wasmer&quot;&gt;Enter Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was at that specific time that I’ve been hired by
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasmerio&#x2F;wasmer&quot;&gt;Wasmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. To be totally honest, I
was looking at Wasmer a few weeks before. It was a surprise and a great
opportunity for me. Well, the universe really wants this rewrite from
&lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to Wasmer, right 😅?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer is organized as a set of Rust libraries (called crates). There is
even a &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; crate which is a C and a C++ API on top of
the &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; crate and the &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-core&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; crate, i.e. it
allows running the WebAssembly virtual machine as you want, with the
backend of your choice: &lt;em&gt;Cranelift&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;LLVM&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Dynasm&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (at the time of
writing). That’s perfect, it removes my Rust library between the PHP
extension and &lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Then &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is reduced to a PHP extension
without any Rust code, everything goes to &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. That’s
sad to remove Rust from this project, but it relies on more Rust code!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting the time to make some patches on &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, I’ve
been able to migrate &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to Wasmer in 5 days.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; uses Wasmer with the Cranelift backend, it
does a great balance between compilation and execution time. It is
really good. Let’s run the benchmark, with the addition of
&lt;code&gt;php+wasmer(cranelift)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rust-baseline&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 287ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 19,761ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php+wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 67,622ms,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;php+wasmer(cranelift)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: 2,365ms 🎉.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the PHP extension provides a faster execution than PHP itself!
&lt;code&gt;php+wasmer(cranelift)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;8.6 times faster&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than &lt;code&gt;php&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to be exact.
And it is &lt;strong&gt;28.6 times faster&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than &lt;code&gt;php+wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Can we reach the
native speed (represented by &lt;code&gt;rust-baseline&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; here)? It’s very likely
with LLVM. That’s for another article. I’m super happy with Cranelift
for the moment. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;wasmer&#x2F;benchmarking-webassembly-runtimes-18497ce0d76e&quot;&gt;our previous blog post to learn how we benchmark
different backends in Wasmer, and other WebAssembly
runtimes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-optimizations&quot;&gt;More Optimizations&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer provides more features, like module caching. Those features are
now included in the PHP extension. When booting the &lt;code&gt;nbody.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file
(19kb), it took 4.2ms. By booting, I mean: reading the WebAssembly
binary from a file, parsing it, validating it, compiling it to
executable code and a WebAssembly module structure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP execution model is: starts, runs, dies. Memory is freed for each
request. If one wants to use &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, you don’t really want to
pay that “&lt;em&gt;booting cost&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;” every time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, &lt;code&gt;wasmer-runtime-c-api&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; now provides a module serialization
API, which is integrated into the PHP extension itself. It saves the
“booting cost”, but it adds a “deserialization cost”. That second cost
is smaller, but still, we need to know it exists.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully again, Zend Engine has an API to get persistent in-memory data
between PHP executions. &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; supports that API to get
persistent modules, &lt;em&gt;et voilà&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it takes &lt;strong&gt;4.2ms&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for the first boot of &lt;code&gt;nbody.wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;0.005ms&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for all the next boots. It’s 840 times faster!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmer is a young — but mature — framework to build WebAssembly runtimes
on top of. The default backend is Cranelift, and it shows its promises:
It brings a correct balance between compilation time and execution time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; has been a good companion to develop a &lt;em&gt;Proof-Of-Concept&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. This
library has its place in other usages though, like very short-living
WebAssembly binaries (I’m thinking of Ethereum contracts that compile to
WebAssembly for instance, which is one of the actual use cases). It’s
important to understand that no runtime is better than another, it
depends on the use case.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to stabilize &lt;code&gt;php-ext-wasm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to release a 1.0.0 version.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHPTour Nantes 2017 (in French):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP est un langage extrêment populaire. En 2015, PHP était utilisé par
plus de 80% de tous les sites Web. Cependant, 500 vulnérabilités
sévères sont répertoriées. Bien qu&#x27;inhérent à tous langages
populaires, cela reste très dangereux. L&#x27;objectif du projet Tagua VM
est de fournir une VM PHP qui garantie un haut niveau de sûreté et de
qualité en supprimant des larges classes de vulnérabilités, grâce à
des outils appropriés comme Rust et LLVM. Rust est un langage
remarquable qui apporte des garanties fortes à propos de la sûreté de
la mémoire. C&#x27;est aussi un langage très rapide qui rivalise avec C.
LLVM est une infrastructure de compilateur célèbre qui apporte de la
modernité, des algorithmes à la pointe, des performances, une suite
d&#x27;outils pour développeur etc. Ce projet va résoudre trois problèmes
en une fois :&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fournir un niveau haut niveau de sûreté et de qualité en
supprimant des larges classes de vulnérabilité, et ainsi éviter
des coûts de bugs dramatiques ;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fournir de la modernité, une nouvelle expérience développeur et
des algorithmes à la pointe de la recherche, donc des performances ;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fournir un ensemble de bibliothèques qui vont composer la VM et
qui pourront être réutiliser en dehors du projet (comme le
parseur, les analyseurs, les extensions etc.).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durant cette conférence, nous présenterons les objectifs de ce projet,
ainsi que son avancement. Nous expliquerons pourquoi il est crucial et
pourquoi il reçoit le soutient d&#x27;une communauté grandissante et de
développeurs notables (avec un rôle important dans le développement de
PHP).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
