That means the same file can\nrun anywhere.\n\nTo uphold this bold statement, each language, platform and system must\nbe able to run WebAssembly â as fast and safely as possible.\n\nWasmer is a WebAssembly runtime\nwritten in Rust. It goes without saying\nthat the runtime can be used in any Rust application. We have also\nsuccessfully embedded the runtime in other languages:\n\nUsing C and C++\nbindings\nIn PHP, using\nphp-ext-wasm\nIn Python, using\npython-ext-wasm â\nwasmer package on PyPI\nIn Ruby, using\nruby-ext-wasm â wasmer\ngem on RubyGems\nIt is now time to hang around Go\nð¹!\n\nWe are super happy to announce github.com/wasmerio/go-ext-wasm/wasmer,\na Go library to run WebAssembly binaries,\nfast.\nCalling a WebAssembly function from Go\nFirst, letâs install wasmer in your go environment (with cgo\nsupport).\n\nLetâs jump immediately into some\nexamples.github.com/wasmerio/go-ext-wasm/wasmer is a regular Go\nlibrary. The installation is automated with\nimport \"github.com/wasmerio/go-ext-wasm/wasmer\".\nLetâs get our hands dirty. We will write a program that compiles to\nWebAssembly easily, using Rust for instance:\n\nAfter compilation to WebAssembly, we get a file like this\none,\nnamed simple.wasm.\nThe following Go program executes the sum function by passing 5 and\n37 as arguments:\n\nGreat! We have successfully executed a WebAssembly file inside Go.\n\nNote: Go values passed to the WebAssembly exported function are\nautomatically cast to WebAssembly values. Types are inferred and\ncasting is done automatically. Thus, a WebAssembly function acts as\nany regular Go function.\n\nWebAssembly calling Go funtions\nA WebAssembly module exports some functions, so that they can be\ncalled from the outside world. This is the entry point to execute\nWebAssembly.\nNonetheless, a WebAssembly module can also have imported functions.\nLetâs consider the following Rust program:\n\nThe exported function add1 calls the sum function. Its\nimplementation is absent, only its signature is defined. This is an\nâextern functionâ, and for WebAssembly, this is an imported function,\nbecause its implementation must be imported.\nLetâs implement the sum function in Go! To do so, need to use\ncgo:\n\nThe sum function signature is defined in C (see the comment above\nimport \"C\"),\nThe sum implementation is defined in Go. Notice the //export\nwhich is the way cgo uses to map Go code to C code,\nNewImports is an API used to create WebAssembly imports. In this\ncode \"sum\" is the WebAssembly imported function name, sum is the\nGo function pointer, and C.sum is the cgo function pointer,\nFinally, NewInstanceWithImports is the constructor to use to\ninstantiate the WebAssembly module with imports. Thatâs it.\n\nLetâs see the complete program:\n\nReading the memory\nA WebAssembly instance has a linear memory. Letâs see how to read it.\nConsider the following Rust program:\n\nThe return_hello function returns a pointer to a string. The string\nterminates by a null byte, Ã  la C. Letâs jump on the Go side:\n\nThe return_hello function returns a pointer as an i32 value. We get\nits value by calling ToI32. Then, we fetch the memory data with\ninstance.Memory.Data().\nThis function returns a slice over the WebAssembly instance memory. It\ncan be used as any regular Go slice.\nFortunately for us, we already know the length of the string we want to\nread, so memory[pointer : pointer+13] is enough to read the bytes,\nthat are then cast to a string. Et voilÃ  !\n\nYou can read the Greet\nExample\nto see a more advanced usage of the memory API.\n\nBenchmarks\nSo far, github.com/wasmerio/go-ext-wasm/wasmer has a nice API, but\nâ¦is it fast?\nContrary to PHP or Ruby, there are already existing runtimes in the Go\nworld to execute WebAssembly. The main candidates are:\n\nLife, from Perlin Network, a\nWebAssembly interpreter\nWagon, from Go Interpreter,\na WebAssembly interpreter and toolkit.\n\nIn our blog post about the PHP\nextension,\nwe have used the n-body\nalgorithm\nto benchmark the performance. Life provides more benchmarks: the\nFibonacci algorithm\n(the recursive version), the Pollardâs rho\nalgorithm, and\nthe Snappy Compress operation. The latter works successfully with\ngithub.com/wasmerio/go-ext-wasm/wasmer but not with Life or Wagon. We\nhave removed it from the benchmark suites. Benchmark\nsources\nare online.\nWe use Life 20190521143330â57f3819c2df0, and Wagon 0.4.0, i.e. the\nlatest versions to date.\nThe benchmark numbers represent the average result for 10 runs each. The\ncomputer that ran these benchmarks is a MacBook Pro 15\" from 2016,\n2.9Ghz Core i7 with 16Gb of memory.\nResults are grouped by benchmark algorithm on the X axis. The Y axis\nrepresents the time used to run the algorithm, expressed in\nmilliseconds. The lower, the better.\n\n\n  \nSpeed comparison between Wasmer, Wagon and Life. Benchmark suites are\nthe n-body, Fibonacci, and Pollardâs rho algorithms. Speed is expressed\nin ms. Lower is better.\n  \n\nWhile both Life and Wagon provide on average the same speed, Wasmer\n(github.com/wasmerio/go-ext/wasmer) is on average 72 times faster\nð.\nIt is important to know that Wasmer comes with 3 backends:\nSinglepass,\nCranelift,\nand\nLLVM.\nThe default backend that is used by the Go library is Cranelift (learn\nmore about Cranelift). Using\nLLVM will provide performance close to native, but we decided to start\nwith Cranelift as it offers the best tradeoff between compilation-time\nand execution-time (learn more about the different\nbackends,\nwhen to use them, pros and cons etc.).\nConclusion\n[github.com/wasmerio/go-ext-wasm/wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/go-ext-wasm)\nis a new Go library to execute WebAssembly binaries. It embeds the\nWasmer runtime. The first version\nsupports all the required API for the most common usages.\nThe current benchmarks (a mix from our benchmark suites and from Life\nsuites) show that Wasmer is â on average â 72 times faster than Life\nand Wagon, the two major existing WebAssembly runtimes in the Go\nworld.\nIf you want to follow the development, take a look at\n@wasmerio and\n@mnt_io on Twitter, or\n@wasmer@webassembly.social on\nMastodon.\nAnd of course, everything is open source at\nwasmerio/go-ext-wasm.\nThank you for your time, we canât wait to see what you build with us!\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/announcing-the-fastest-webassembly-runtime-for-go-wasmer/","title":"Announcing the fastest WebAssembly runtime for Go: wasmer"},"https://mnt.io/articles/announcing-the-first-java-library-to-run-webassembly-wasmer-jni/":{"body":"This is a copy of an article I wrote for\nWasmer.\n\nWebAssembly is a portable binary format.\nThat means the same file can run anywhere.\n\nTo uphold this bold statement, each language, platform and system must\nbe able to run WebAssembly â as fast and safely as possible.\n\nPeople who are familiar with Wasmer are used to this kind of\nannouncement! Wasmer is written in Rust, and comes with an additional\nnative C API. But you can use it in a lot of other languages. After\nhaving announced libraries to use Wasmer, and thus WebAssembly, in:\n\n\nPHP with the ext/wasm\nextension,\n\n\nPython with the wasmer\nlibrary,\n\n\nRuby with the wasmer\nlibrary,\n\n\nGo with the wasmer\nlibrary (see Announcing\nthe fastest WebAssembly runtime for\nGo: wasmer,\nand even\n\n\nPostgres with the wasmer\nlibrary (see\nAnnouncing the first Postgres extension to run\nWebAssembly),\n\n\nand many other contributions in\n.NET/C#,\nR and\nElixirâ¦\n\n\nâ¦we are jazzed to announce that Wasmer has now landed in\nJava!\nLetâs discover the Wasmer JNI library together.\nInstallation\nThe Wasmer JNI (Java Native Interface) library is based on the Wasmer\nruntime, which is written in\nRust, and is compiled to a shared library.\nFor your convenience, we produce one JAR (Java Archive) per\narchitecture and platform. By now, the following are supported,\nconsistently tested, and pre-packaged (available in\nBintray and Github\nReleases):\n\n\namd64-darwin for macOS, x86 64bits,\n\n\namd64-linux for Linux, x86 64 bits,\n\n\namd64-windows for Windows, x86 64 bits.\n\n\nMore architectures and more platforms will be added in the near future.\nIf you need a specific one, feel free to\nask!\nHowever, it is possible to produce your own JAR for your own platform\nand\narchitecture.\nThe JAR files are named as follows:\nwasmer-jni-$(architecture)-$(os)-$(version).jar. Thus, to include\nWasmer JNI as a dependency of your project (assuming you use\nGradle), write for instance:\n\nJAR are hosted on the Bintray/JCenter repository under the\n[wasmer-jni](https://bintray.com/wasmer/wasmer-jni/wasmer-jni)\nproject. They are also attached to our Github releases as\nassets.\nCalling a WebAssembly function from Java\nAs usual, letâs start with a simple Rust program that we will compile to\nWebAssembly, and then execute from Java.\n\nAfter compilation to WebAssembly, we get a file like this\none,\nnamed simple.wasm.\nThe following Java program executes the sum exported function by\npassing 5 and 37 as arguments:\n\nGreat! We have successfully executed a Rust program, compiled to\nWebAssembly, in Java. As you can see, it is pretty straightforward. The\nAPI is very similar to the standard JavaScript API, or the other API we\nhave designed for PHP, Python, Go, Ruby etc.\nThe assiduous reader might have noticed the [0] in .apply(5, 37)[0]\npattern. A WebAssembly function can return zero to many values, and in\nthis case, we are reading the first one.\n\nNote: Java values passed to WebAssembly exported functions are\nautomatically downcasted to WebAssembly values. Types are inferred at\nruntime, and casting is done automatically. Thus, a WebAssembly\nfunction acts as any regular Java function.\n\nTechnically, an exported function is a functional interface as defined\nby the Java Language Specification (i.e. it is a\n[FunctionalInterface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html)).\nThus, it is possible to write the following code where sum is an\nactual function (of kind org.wasmer.exports.Function):\n\nBut a WebAssembly module not only exports functions, it also exports\nmemory.\nReading the memory\nA WebAssembly instance has one or more linear memories, a contiguous and\nbyte-addressable range of memory spanning from offset 0 and extending up\nto a varying memory size, represented by the org.wasmer.Memory class.\nLetâs see how to use it. Consider the following Rust program:\n\nThe return_hello function returns a pointer to the statically\nallocated string. The string exists in the linear memory of the\nWebAssembly module. It is then possible to read it in Java:\n\nAs we can see, the Memory API provides a buffer method. It returns a\ndirect byte\nbuffer\n(of kind java.nio.ByteBuffer) view of the memory. Itâs a standard API\nfor any Java developer. We think itâs best to not reinvent the wheel and\nuse standard API as much as possible.\nThe WebAssembly memory is dissociated from the JVM memory, and thus from\nthe garbage collector.\n\nYou can read the Greet\nExample\nto see a more in-depth usage of the Memory API.\n\nMore documentation\nThe project comes with a Makefile. The make javadoc command will\ngenerate a traditional local Javadoc for you, in the\nbuild/docs/javadoc/index.html file.\nIn addition, the projectâs README.md file has an API of\nthe wasmer library\nSection.\nFinally, the project comes with a set of\nexamples.\nUse the make run-example EXAMPLE=Simple to run the\nSimpleExample.java example for instance.\nPerformance\nWebAssembly aims at being safe, but also fast. Since Wasmer JNI is the\nfirst Java library to execute WebAssembly, we canât compare to prior\nworks in the Java ecosystem. However, you might know that Wasmer comes\nwith 3 backends: Singlepass, Cranelift and LLVM. Weâve even written an\narticle about it: A WebAssembly Compiler\ntale.\nThe Wasmer JNI library uses the Cranelift backend for the moment, which\noffers the best compromise between compilation-time and execution-time.\nCredits\nAsami (d0iasm on Twitter) has improved\nthis project during its internship at Wasmer under my guidance. She\nfinished the internship before the release of the Wasmer JNI project,\nbut she deserves credits for pushing the project forward! Good work\nAsami!\nThis is an opportunity to remind everyone that we hire anywhere in the\nworld. Asami was working from Japan while I am working from Switzerland,\nand the rest of the team is from US, Spain, China etc. Feel free to\ncontact me (@mnt_io or\n@syrusakbary on Twitter) if you want\nto join us on this big adventure!\nConclusion\nWasmer JNI is a library to execute WebAssembly directly in Java. It\nembeds the WebAssembly runtime\nWasmer. The first releases provide\nthe core API with Module, Instance, and Memory. It comes\npre-packaged as a JAR, one per architecture and per platform.\nThe source code is open and hosted on Github at\nwasmerio/java-ext-wasm.\nWe are constantly improving the project, so if you have feedback,\nissues, or feature requests please open an issue in the repository, or\nreach us on Twitter at @wasmerio or\n@mnt_io.\nWe look forward to see what you build with this!\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/announcing-the-first-java-library-to-run-webassembly-wasmer-jni/","title":"Announcing the first Java library to run WebAssembly: Wasmer JNI"},"https://mnt.io/articles/announcing-the-first-postgres-extension-to-run-webassembly/":{"body":"This is a copy of an article I wrote for\nWasmer.\n\nWebAssembly is a portable binary format. That means the same program can\nrun anywhere.\n\nTo uphold this bold statement, each language, platform and system must\nbe able to run WebAssembly â as fast and safely as possible.\n\nLetâs say it again. Wasmer is a\nWebAssembly runtime. We have successfully embedded the runtime in other\nlanguages:\n\nIn Rust, as it is written in Rust\nUsing C and C++\nbindings\nIn PHP, using\nphp-ext-wasm\nIn Python, using\npython-ext-wasm â\nwasmer package on PyPI\nIn Ruby, using\nruby-ext-wasm â wasmer\ngem on RubyGems\nIn Go, using go-ext-wasm\nâ see the\nannouncement.\n\nThe community has also embedded Wasmer in awesome projects:\n\n.NET/C#, using\nWasmerSharp\nR, using Wasmr.\n\nIt is now time to continue the story and to hang aroundâ¦\nPostgres!\nWe are so happy to announce a newcrazy idea: WebAssembly on\nPostgres. Yes, you read that correctly. On\nPostgres.\nCalling a WebAssembly function from Postgres\nAs usual, we have to go through the installation process. There is no\npackage manager for Postgres, so itâs a manual step. The Installation\nSection of the\ndocumentation\nexplains the details; here is a summary:\n\nOnce the extension is installed, activated and initialized, we can start\nhaving fun!\nThe current API is rather small, however basic features are available.\nThe goal is to gather a community and to design a pragmatic API\ntogether, discover the expectations, how developers would use this new\ntechnology inside a database engine.\nLetâs see how it works. To instantiate a WebAssembly module, we use the\nwasm_new_instance function. It takes 2 arguments: The absolute path to\nthe WebAssembly module, and a prefix for the module exported functions.\nIndeed, if a module exports a function named sum, then a Postgres\nfunction named prefix_sum calling the sum function will be created\ndynamically.\nLetâs see it in action. Letâs start by editing a Rust program that\ncompiles to WebAssembly:\n\nOnce this file compiled to simple.wasm, we can instantiate the module,\nand call the exported sum function:\n\nEt voilÃ  ! The ns_sum function calls the Rust sum function through\nWebAssembly! How fun is that ð?\nInspect a WebAssembly instance\nThis section shows how to inspect a WebAssembly instance. At the same\ntime, it quickly explains how the extension works under the hood.\nThe extension provides two foreign data wrappers, gathered together in\nthe wasm foreign schema:\n\nwasm.instances is a table with the id and wasm_file columns,\nrespectively for the unique instance ID, and the path of the\nWebAssembly module,\nwasm.exported_functions is a table with the instance_id,name,\ninputs, and outputs columns, respectively for the instance ID of\nthe exported function, its name, its input types (already formatted\nfor Postgres), and its output types (already formatted for Postgres).\n\nLetâs see:\n\nBased on these information, the wasm Postgres extension is able to\ngenerate the SQL function to call the WebAssembly exported functions.\nIt sounds simplistic, andâ¦ to be honest, it is! The trick is to use\nforeign data\nwrappers,\nwhich is an awesome feature of Postgres.\nHow fast is it, or: Is it an interesting alternative to PL/pgSQL?\nAs we said, the extension API is rather small for now. The idea is to\nexplore, to experiment, to have fun with WebAssembly inside a database.\nIt is particularly interesting in two cases:\n\nTo write extensions or procedures with any languages that compile to\nWebAssembly in place of\nPL/pgSQL,\nTo remove a potential performance bottleneck where speed is\ninvolved.\n\nThus we run a basic benchmark. Like most of the benchmarks out there, it\nmust be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThe goal is to compare the execution time between WebAssembly and\nPL/pgSQL, and see how both approaches scale.\n\nThe Postgres WebAssembly extension uses\nWasmer as the\nruntime, compiled with the Cranelift backend (learn more about the\ndifferent\nbackends).\nWe run the benchmark with Postgres 10, on a MacBook Pro 15\" from 2016,\n2.9Ghz Core i7 with 16Gb of memory.\nThe methodology is the following:\n\nLoad both the plpgsql_fibonacci and the wasm_fibonacci functions,\nRun them with a query like\nSELECT *_fibonacci(n) FROM generate_series(1, 1000) where n has\nthe following values: 50, 500, and 5000, so that we can observe how\nboth approaches scale,\nWrite the timings down,\nRun this methodology multiple times, and compute the median of the\nresults.\n\nHere come the results. The lower, the better.\n\n\n  \nComparing WebAssembly vs. PL/pgSQL when computing the Fibonacci sequence\nwith n=50, 500 and 5000.\n  \n\nWe notice that the Postgres WebAssembly extension is faster to run\nnumeric computations. The WebAssembly approach scales pretty well\ncompared to the PL/pgSQL approach, in this situation.\nWhen to use the WebAssembly extension?\nSo far, the extension only supports integers (on 32- and 64-bits). The\nextension doesnât support strings yet. It also doesnât support\nrecords, views or other Postgres types. Keep in mind this is the very\nfirst step.\nHence, it is too soon to tell whether WebAssembly can be an alternative\nto PL/pgSQL. But regarding the benchmark results above, we are sure they\ncan live side-by-side, WebAssembly has clearly a place in the ecosystem!\nAnd we want to continue to pursue this exploration.\nConclusion\nWe are already talking with people that are interested in using\nWebAssembly inside databases. If you have any particular use cases,\nplease reach us at wasmer.io, or on Twitter at\n@wasmerio directly or me\n@mnt_io.\nEverything is open source, as usual! Happy hacking.\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/announcing-the-first-postgres-extension-to-run-webassembly/","title":"Announcing the first Postgres extension to run WebAssembly"},"https://mnt.io/articles/atoum-has-two-release-managers/":{"body":"What is atoum?\nShort introduction: atoum is a simple, modern and intuitive unit testing\nframework for PHP. Originally created by FrÃ©dÃ©ric\nHardy, a good friend, it has grown thanks\nto many\ncontributors.\n\n\n  \n  atoum's logo.\n  \n\nNo one can say that atoum is not simple or intuitive. The framework\noffers several awesome features and is more like a meta unit testing\nframework. Indeed, the âuser-landâ of atoum, I mean all the assertions\nAPI (âthis is an integer and it is equal toâ¦â) is based on a very\nflexible mechanism, handled or embedded in runners, reporters etc. Thus,\nthe framework is very extensible. You can find more informations in the\nREADME.md of the project: Why\natoum?.\nSeveral important projects or companies use atoum. For instance,\nPickle, the PHP Extension\ninstaller, created by Pierre Joye,\nanother friend (the world is very small&nbsp;ð) use atoum for its unit\ntests. Another example with M6Web, the geeks\nworking at M6, the\nmost profitable private national French TV channel, also use atoum.\nAnother example, Mozilla is using atoum to test\nsome of their applications.\nWhere is the cap'tain?\nSince the beginning, FrÃ©dÃ©ric has been a great leader for the project.\nHe has inspired many people, users and contributors. In real life, on\nstage, on IRCâ¦ its personality and charisma were helpful in all aspects.\nHowever, leading such a project is a challenging and nerve-wracking\ndaily work. I know what I am talking about with\nHoa. Hopefully for FrÃ©dÃ©ric, some\ncontributors were here to help.\nWhere to go cap'tain?\nHowever, having contributors do not create a community. A community is a\ngroup of people that share something together. A project needs a\ncommunity with strong connections. They do no need to all look at the\nsame direction, but they have to share something. In the case of atoum,\nI would say the project has been victim of its own success. We have\nseen the number of users increasing very quickly and the project was not\nyet ready for such a massive use. The documentation was not ready, a lot\nof features were not finalized, there were few contributors and the\nabsence of a real community did not help. Put all these things together,\nblend them together and you obtain a bomb&nbsp;ð. The project leaders were\nunder a terrible pressure.\nIn these conditions, this is not easy to work. Especially when users ask\nfor new features. The needs to have a roadmap and people taking\ndecisions were very strong.\nWhen the community acts\nAfter a couple of months under the sea, we have decided that we need to\ncreate a structure around the project. An organization. FrÃ©dÃ©ric is not\nable to do everything by himself. That's why 2&nbsp;release managers have\nbeen elected: MikaÃ«l Randy and I. Thank you to Julien\nBianchi, another friend&nbsp;ð, for having organized\nthese elections and being one of the most active contributor of atoum!\nOur goal is to define the roadmap of atoum:\n\nwhat will be included in the next version and what will not,\nwhat features need work,\nwhat bugs or issues need to be solved,\netc.\n\nWell, a release manager is a pretty common job.\nWhy 2? To avoid the bus effect and delegate. We all have a family,\nfriends, jobs and side projects. With 2 release managers, we have\n2&nbsp;times more time to organize this project, and it deserves such an\namount of time.\nThe goal is also to organize the community if it is possible. New great\nfeatures are coming and they will allow more people to contribute and\nbuild their âown atoumâ. See below.\nFeatures to port!\nEverything is not defined at 100% but here is an overview of what is\ncoming.\nFirst of all, you will find the latest issues and\nbugs we have to close\nbefore the first release.\nSecond, you will notice the version numberâ¦ 1.0.0. Yes! atoum will have\ntags! After several discussions\n(#261,\n#300,\n#342,\n#349â¦), even if atoum is\nrolling-released, it will have tags. And with the semver\nformat. More informations on the blog of Julien\nBianchi: atoum embraces semver.\nFinally, a big feature is the Extension\nAPI, that allows to write\nextension, such as:\n\natoum/visibility-extension,\nallows to override methods visibility; example:\n\n\nNow you will be able to test your protected and private methods!\n\natoum/bdd-extension,\nallows to write tests with the behavior-driven development style and\nvocabulary; example:\n\n\nEven the output looks familiar:\n\n\n  \n  Possible output with the `atoum/bdd-extension`.\n  \n\n\natoum/json-schema-extension,\nallows to validate JSON payloads against a schema; example:\n\n\n\natoum/praspel-extension,\nallows to use Praspel inside\natoum: automatically generate and validate advanced test data and unit\ntests; example:\n\n\nHere, we have generated a string based on its regular expression.\nReminder, you might have seen this on this blog: Generate strings based\non regular\nexpressions.\nFun fact: the atoum/json-schema-extension is tested with atoum\nobviously andâ¦ atoum/praspel-extension!\nConclusion\natoum has a bright future with exciting features!

The URL patterns are the followings:\n\n/articles/&lt;article-id&gt;/ to view an article,\n/series/&lt;series-id&gt;/ to view all episodes of a series,\n/series/&lt;series-id&gt;/&lt;episode-id&gt;/ to view a particular episode of a series.\n\nHomepage\nThe homepage provides:\n\nthe latest series, and\npinned articles.\n\nTo pin an article, I add the following TOML declarations in the frontmatter of\nan article:\n\nThis pinned declaration is not recognised by Zola: the [extra] section\ncontains user-defined values. Then, it's a matter of filtering by this value in\nthe template:\n\nThat's a nice feature to promote some articles.\nIn comparison to WordPress.com, the new homepage is 36.8KiB, that's 31 times less!\nArticles\nAn article has some metadata like:\n\nthe publishing time,\nthe reading time,\nkeywords,\nedition.\n\nIf you read this article in October 2024, you might see all that in this very\narticle. The beauty of this hides in the source code though:\n\nFirst off, the site uses HTML semantics as much as possible with article,\nheader, time, meta etc. Second, you may also notice the vocab, typeof,\nproperty and content attributes. This is an extension to HTML for Resource\nDescription Framework in Attributes (RDFa for short). This is common to\nadd more semantics data to your content. It helps automated tools to analyse the\ncontent of a Web document, and makes sense of it. schema.org is a\ncollaborative effort to create schemas for structured data, and that's what I\nuse in this site for the moment.\nLast neat thing: did you notice you can edit the page? The code lives on Github,\nand everyone is free to submit a patch!\nSeries\nA series is pretty similar to an article, except that it adds another level of\nindirection with episodes.\nSimilarly to articles with pinned, a series has its own metadata:\n\ncomplete indicates whether the series is complete or in progress.\nA series also has buttons to navigate to the previous or the next episodes.\nNothing fancy, but it's fun to be able to do all that with Zola.\nThe hierarchy is intuitive to understand, and it uses RDFa heavily too, for\nexample a series overview with all its episodes looks like this:\n\nFirst off, we use the role HTML attribute to change the semantics\nof some elements: here div become a ul or a li. Second, we use\ntypeof=\"CreativeWorkSeries\" to describe a series, which is composed\nof different parts: property=\"hasPart\". Each part is an article:\ntypeof=\"Article\", which has its own semantics: property=\"name\" etc. The\nmarkup is extremely simple but it contains all required information. HTML is\nreally powerful, I'm not going to lie!\nDiscuss\nOne novelty is the Discuss menu item at the top of the site. It contains a\nlink to a Matrix public room: https://matrix.to/#/#mnt_io:matrix.org, where\nanybody can come to talk about an article, a series, ask questions, or simply\nchill. You're very welcome there!\nGood ol' Web\nThe site has a short CSS stylesheet written by hand with no framework (oh yeah).\nIt weights 11KiB (uncompressed), heavy, I know.\nThe site also has RSS and Atom feeds for syndications. It even has a\nblogroll under the Recommandations Section in the footer. Well, you get it,\nI'm nostalgic of the old Web. It's absolutely incredible what it is possible\nto achieve today with HTML and CSS without any frameworks or polyfills. So much\nresources are wasted nowadaysâ¦\nPersonnages\nThe biggest novelty is the lore I've developed for this new version\nof the site. Please, welcome 3&nbsp;characters: Le Compte, Le Factotum, and Le\nProcureur.\nThese characters will help to explain not trivial concepts by interacting with\nme. Let me copy the lore here.\nLe Comte\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  My name is Le&nbsp;Comte. I enjoy being the main character of this story. I am\nmostly here to learn, and to interrogate our dear author.\nMy resources are unlimited. I am fortunate to have a fortune with a secret\norigin. If I want to understand something, I will work as hard as possible to\ntry to make light on it. My new caprice is these new modern things people are\ncalling computers. They seem really powerful and I want to learn everything\nabout them!\nI often ask help to my Factotum for the dirty, and sometimes illegal tasks. I\nrarely ask help to Le&nbsp;Procureur, we don't really appreciate his presence.\n\n\nLe Factotum\n\n  \n    Le Factotum\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  My name is Le&nbsp;Factotum. It's a latin word, literally saying âdo everythingâ.\nI'm here to assist Le&nbsp;Comte in its fancies.\nEven if I have an uneventful life now, Le&nbsp;Comte is partly aware of my smuggling\npast. He says no word about it, but he knows I kept contact with old friends\nacross various countries and cultures. These relations are useful to Le&nbsp;Comte to\nachieve its quests to learn everything about computers.\nFundamentally, when Le&nbsp;Comte wants to do something manky, he asks me the best\nway to do that. And I always have a solution.\n\n\nLe Procureur\n\n  \n    Le Procureur\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  My name is Le&nbsp;Procureur. I am the son of the Law and the Order. I know what\nis legal, and what is illegal. If an information is missing, a detail, an\nexactness, I know where to find the answer.\nSome people believe I am irritating, but I consider myself the defenser of\ndiscipline.\n\n\nOptimised for smallness, speed, semantics and fun!\nAt this step, it should be clear the site has been optimised for smallness,\nspeed and semantics. Even the fonts aren't custom: I use Modern Font Stacks\nto find a font stacks that work on most computers. Two devices may not have the\nsame look and feel for this site and that's perfectly fine. That's the nature of\nthe Web.\nI encourage you to read the source code of this site, to fork it, to\nplay with it, to get inspired by it. It's important to own your content, and to\nnot give your work to other platforms.\nI really hope you'll enjoy the content I'm preparing. You can start with the\nfirst episode of the new series: Reactive programming in Rust,\nObservability.\nSee you there!\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/building-a-new-site/","title":"Building a new site!"},"https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-automattic-hello-wasmer/":{"body":"Today is my first day at Wasmer.\nIt's with a lot of regrets that I leave Automattic. To be clear, I'm not\nleaving because something negative happened, I'm leaving because I've\nreceived the same job offer, 3 times in 10 days, from Wasmer, Google and\nMozilla. Namely to work with Rust or C++ to build a WebAssembly runtime.\nThis is an offer I can barely decline. It's an opportunity and a dream\nfor me. And I was lucky enough to get a choice between 3 excellent\ncompanies!\nI can only encourage you to work with\nAutomattic.

The culture, the spirit, the interactions between people,\nthe mission, everything is exceptional. It has been a super great\nexperience.\nI could write 100 pages about my team.

Liip was a great\nexperience. It was my first industrial non-remote job. It was also my\nfirst job in the country I am currently living in. And I have discovered\na new way of working.\nFirst industrial non-remote job\nBefore working for Liip, I was working for fruux.\nMy situation was the following: A french citizen, living as a foreigner\nin Switzerland, working for a German company, with employees from\nGermany, Holland, and Canada. Everything happened on chat, mail, and\nSkype. When my son was born, I had to change my work to simplify my\nlife. It was not the only reason, but one of them.\nAnd before fruux, I was working for INRIA, a\nresearch institute in France. It was partially a remote job.\nLiip has several offices. I was based in Lausanne.\nSo, yes, Liip was my first industrial non-remote job. And I liked it.\nWorking in the train on the morning, walking in Lausanne, seeing real\npeople, everything in my local language. Because yes, it was my first\njob in my native language too.\nEverything was simpler. And when you have your first baby, anything else\nthat is simpler saves your life.\nIntroducing Holacracy\nGiant discussions were happening to remove any form of hierarchy in\nLiip. Then we discovered\nHolacracy, and we started\nmoving to this system. This is a new governance system. If you are\nfamiliar with distributed network topologies in Computer Science, or\ndata structures, it really looks like a Distributed Spanning\nTree\n[DahanPN09]. Note:\nI am sure that the authors of Holacracy are not aware of DST, but, eh.\nSo nothing new from a research point of view, but it is cool to see this\nalgorithm coming alive in real life. And it worked: Less meetings, more\nself-organisation, more shared responsabilities, no more âbossâ etc.\nThis is not a tool for all companies, but I am sure that if you are\nreading my blog, then your company should give it a try.\nOpen source projects\nLiip has been very generous with me regarding my open source\nengagements. I was involved in Hoa,\natoum, and\nPickle when joining the\ncompany. Liip gave me a 5% budget, so roughly 1 hour per day to work on\nHoa. Thank you for that!\nAfter that, I have started a new big project, called Tagua\nVM. They gave me an additional 5%\nbudget. So I got 2 hours per day to work on Hoa and Tagua VM. Again, thank\nyou for that!\nFinally, I have started an in-house open project called The A11y\nMachine (a11ym for short). I\nhave written a case study for this tool on the Liip's blog:\nAccessibility: make your website barrier-free with\na11ym!\nThe goal of a11ym is to automate the accessibility testing of any site\nby crawling and testing each page. A sweet report is generated, showing\nall errors, warnings, and notices, with all information needed by the\ndeveloper to fix the issues as fast as possible.\n\n\n  \nDashboard of a11ym, showing the evolution of the accessibility of a site\nin time\n  \n\n\n\n  \nA typical a11ym report listing all errors, warnings, and notices for a\ngiven URL\n  \n\nThis project has received really good feedbacks from the accessibility\ncommunity. It has been downloaded 7000 times so far, which is not bad\nconsidering the niche it targets.\nA new SaaS platform is being build around this software. I enjoyed\nworking on it, and it was really tangible.\nMain customer, huge project\nLiip is a Web agency, so you have dozens of customers at the same time.\nHowever, I was in a special team for an important customer. The site is\na luxury watches and jewellery e-commerce platform, located in several\ncountries, in 10 languages, accessible from 16 domains, shared in 2\ndatacenters. This is not a casual site.\nI learned a lot about all the complexity such a site brings: Checkout\nrules (oh damnedâ¦), product catalogs in different formats for different\ncountries with different references, all the business logic inherent to\neach country, different payment providers, crazy front end\ncompatibilities etc.\nI have a hundred of crazy anecdotes to tell. This was clearly not a job\nfor me at first glance: I am a researcher, I have an open source culture\nbackground, I am not tailored for this kind of project. But at the end\nof the story, I learned a lot. Really a lot. I have a better overview of\nthe crazy things any customer can ask, or has to deal with, and the\ninfrastructure craziness that can be set up. I learned how to make\nbetter things: How to transform a really crappy software into something\nunderstandable by everyone, how to not break a 10+ years old progam with\nno test etc. And it requires skills. I learned it the hard way, but I\nlearned it.\nWhy leaving?\nBecause even if I learned during my time at Liip, the Web agency model\nwas definitively not for me. I am very thankful to every Liiper, I had a\ngreat time, I love the Web, but not in an agency.\nMy son is now 21 months old, and I need fresh air. I can take new\nchallenges.\nWelcome Automattic\nAutomattic is the company behind\nWordPress.com,\nWooCommerce,\nAkismet, Simplenote,\nCloudup, Simperium,\nGravatar and other giant services.\nI came to Automattic by coincidence. I was looking for a sponsor for\nTagua VM, and someone pointed me out Automattic. After some researches\nabout the company, it appears that it could be a really great place\nwhere to work. So I applied.\nThe hiring process was 4 months long. It was exhausting because it\nhappened at the same time than a big sprint at Liip (remember the SaaS\nplatform for The A11y Machine?). But after 4 months, it appears I\nsucceeded, and I am very glad of that fact!\nI am just starting my job at Automattic. I don't have anything strong\nand finite to say now, apart that everything is just awesome so far. In\nfew weeks, I am likely to write about my start at Automattic I did, see\nWelcome to Chaos. They\nhave a very interesting way to get you on board.\nTime for a new adventure!\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-liip-hello-automattic/","title":"Bye bye Liip, hello Automattic"},"https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-whatsapp-hello/":{"body":"Ce billet est en franÃ§ais, essentiellement Ã  destination de mes ami(e)s\net familles, il sert Ã  vulgariser trÃ¨s rapidement les enjeux autour de\nWhatsApp,\nSignal, Telegram\net Matrix (spoiler, c'est le gagnant). Tout le\nmonde me pose la mÃªme question, alors voici une rÃ©ponse rapidement en\nbrouillon qui va m'Ã©viter du copier/coller !\nJe ne rentre volontairement pas dans les dÃ©tails. Il faut que ce\ndocument reste Ã  la portÃ©e de tous, sans aucune connaissance en rÃ©seau,\nchiffrement, sÃ©curitÃ© etc. Ceux qui ont ces connaissances savent dÃ©jÃ \nque Matrix est le rÃ©seau vers lequel aller ;-).\nLes bases\nQuand on parle de messageries, il y a 2 choses primordiales plus 1 bonus&nbsp;:\n\nle chiffrement&nbsp;;\nla topologie du rÃ©seau (c'est facile, n'ayez pas peur)&nbsp;;\nl'accÃ¨s libre et gratuit sans restriction au code source (open\nsource).\n\nNous pouvons aussi parler du modÃ¨le Ã©conomique du rÃ©seau rapidement,\nvoir le tableau comparatif.\nLe chiffrement\nPour respecter la vie privÃ©e et Ã©viter l'espionnage et le vol des\ndonnÃ©es, il faut que le chiffrement se fasse de bout en bout (end to\nend encryption). Ãa veut dire que vous seul avez la clÃ© pour chiffrer\net/ou dÃ©chiffrer vos messages, et personne d'autre. Par message,\nj'entends message texte, audio, image, vidÃ©o, appels audios-vidÃ©os,\ntout. Vos donnÃ©es sont Ã  vous, et uniquement vous, et personne ne peut\nles utiliser, Ã  part la personne avec qui vous les partagez (qui elle,\nnormalement Ã  une clÃ© de dÃ©chiffrement par exemple). Les clÃ©s servent\naussi Ã  identifier la personne avec qui vous parlez, Ã§a permet d'Ã©viter\nle vol d'identitÃ©.\nLa topologie\nLa plupart des rÃ©seaux sont centralisÃ©s : Ã§a veut dire qu'on a un gros\nsilot, un Ã©norme ordinateur/serveur, et que tout le monde est dessus. Ãa\npose plein de problÃ¨mes&nbsp;:\n\nimpossible d'avoir le contrÃ´le dessus&nbsp;;\nimpossible de faire confiance&nbsp;;\nfaille unique.\n\nJe prends l'exemple de WhatsApp pour illustrer tout Ã§a parce que Ã§a\nparle Ã  tout le monde : Facebook dÃ©cide unilatÃ©ralement de dÃ©chiffrer le\nrÃ©seau, personne n'a le contrÃ´le dessus, c'est une violation grave de la\nvie privÃ©e de milliards de personnes et on ne peut rien faire (Ã  part\nquitter le rÃ©seau). Avions-nous confiance dans ce que faisait Facebook\navec nos donnÃ©es WhatsApp avant ? Non, aucunement. Ils disaient que\nc'Ã©tait chiffrÃ©, l'Ã©tait-ce vraiment ? J'accorde plus de confiance dans\nceux qui ont crÃ©Ã© et chiffrÃ© le rÃ©seau avant qu'il ne soit rachetÃ© par\nFacebook, donc j'ai envie d'y croire, maisâ¦ je ne peux pas le vÃ©rifier\n! Pourquoi ? Parce que personne (en dehors de quelques employÃ©s chez\nFacebook) n'a accÃ¨s au code source, aux programmes, qui font tourner\nWhatsApp. Et pour le cÃ´tÃ© faille unique, si Facebook est attaquÃ©,\nc'est l'entiÃ¨retÃ© du rÃ©seau qui s'effondre, c'est une faille unique, un\nsingle point of failure comme on dit dans le mÃ©tier. Pareil si le\nrÃ©seau est hackÃ©, c'est un accÃ¨s illimitÃ© Ã  tout le rÃ©seau.\n\nAucune transparence = aucune confiance.\n\nMais il existe une alternative majeure bien sÃ»r ! Les rÃ©seaux\ndÃ©centralisÃ©s. Au lieu d'avoir un serveur, il y a en des centaines, des\nmilliers. Il n'y a plus de contrÃ´le possible. Il n'y a plus de single\npoint of failure. Un hacker ne peut accÃ©der au pire qu'aux donnÃ©es\nd'un seul serveur, pas de tous les serveurs (il existe pleins\nd'exceptions mais je vulgarise, hein). Nous pouvons crÃ©er autant de\nserveurs que nous le souhaitons. Souvent, ce sont des rÃ©seaux open\nsource, donc nous pouvons lire le code des programmes, vÃ©rifier qu'ils\nfont bien ce qu'ils proclament faire.\nTableau comparatif\nComparons les services populaires avec ces critÃ¨res de bases.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Service\n        Chiffrement\n        Topologie\n        Open source\n      \n      \n        WhatsApp\n        bout en bout (pour le moment)\n        centralisÃ© (US)\n        non\n      \n      \n        Telegram\n        bout en bout (pour le moment)\n        centralisÃ© (DubaÃ¯, US)\n        non\n      \n      \n        Signal\n        bout en bout\n        centralisÃ© (US)\n        oui maisâ¦\n      \n      \n        Matrix\n        bout en bout\n        dÃ©centralisÃ©\n        oui\n      \n    \n  \n  \nComparons la base !\n  \n\nSignal est open source, mais nous ne pouvons pas vÃ©rifier ce qui est\ninstallÃ© sur les serveurs, parce que le serveur est privÃ©. De plus, le\nserveur open source n'a pas Ã©tÃ© mis Ã  jour depuis avril\n2020, en annÃ©e\nInformatique, c'est trÃ¨s long. Ãa cache quelque chose ? Aucune idÃ©e, je\nne peux pas le savoir, car je n'ai pas d'Ã©lÃ©ments pour prendre une\ndÃ©cision. Est-ce que je veux dÃ©poser mes donnÃ©es privÃ©es sur un service\ndans lequel je n'ai pas confiance ?\nEn plus, Signal comme WhatsApp sont hÃ©bergÃ©s/situÃ©s aux US, avec les\nlois liberticides qu'on leur connaÃ®t bien (comme le Cloud Act). Signal\nlimite la casse grÃ¢ce au chiffrement de bout en bout, mais peut Ãªtre\nqu'une backdoor est prÃ©sente et qu'on ne le saura jamais.\n\nAucune transparence = aucune confiance\n\nLes rÃ©seaux dÃ©centralisÃ©s sont supÃ©rieurs Ã  tous les niveaux (pas de\ncontrÃ´le, pas de hack massif etc.). Les rÃ©seaux open source sont ceux en\nqui nous pouvons avoir confiance. Donc le choix est vite fait, le\ngagnant ici est Matrix.\nComparons maintenant comment les services sont financÃ©s, parce que c'est\nimportant. Si un service n'est pas rentable, il pourrait avoir de\nl'appÃ©tit pour les donnÃ©es de ses utilisateurs, et lÃ  c'est dangereux\n(c'est exactement ce qu'il se passe avec Facebook et WhatsApp).\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Service\n        Revenues\n      \n      \n        WhatsApp\n        Facebook veut utiliser les donnÃ©es privÃ©es pour vendre de la publicitÃ© ciblÃ©e.\n      \n      \n        Telegram\n        Les fondateurs sont millionnaires et injectent de l'argent.Dans peu de temps, financement via pubs et comptes premiums.\n      \n      \n        Signal\n        Organisation Ã  but non-lucratif qui opÃ¨re via des dons.\n      \n      \n        Matrix\n        Matrix dÃ©veloppe, offre ou vend des services autour du rÃ©seau, mais pas autour des donnÃ©es !\n      \n    \n  \n  \nComment sont financÃ©s les services ?\n  \n\nLes gagnants ici sont Signal et Matrix.\nConclusion : Matrix gagnant\nDans le cas des rÃ©seaux centralisÃ©s, Signal est une meilleure\nalternative Ã  WhatsApp et Telegram de part son mode de financement (donc\nson appÃ©tit pour les donnÃ©es des utilisateurs), mais ils sont tous\nsujets aux mÃªme problÃ¨mes : aucune confiance car pas de transparence,\nhÃ©bergÃ©s aux US etc.\nMais les rÃ©seaux dÃ©centralisÃ©s sont supÃ©rieurs car ils rÃ©solvent tous\nces problÃ¨mes ! Matrix est dÃ©centralisÃ©, est financÃ© par des services\nautour du rÃ©seau mais pas par les donnÃ©es du rÃ©seau (qui sont\ninaccessibles de toute faÃ§on, elles n'existent que sur vos tÃ©lÃ©phones et\nordinateurs, nul part ailleurs).\nJ'utilise Matrix. Je vous conseille d'utiliser Matrix. Partir sur\nSignal, c'est sortir de la gueule d'un loup pour aller dans celle d'un\nautre. Je suis admiratif du travail des dÃ©veloppeurs de chez Signal, ils\nsont vraiment bons, leur protocole de chiffrement est magnifique, mais\nje n'ai pas confiance dans leur service parce que je ne peux pas. Et\npersonne ne le peut.\nJ'utilise aussi WhatsApp et Signal pour rester en contact avec mes amis\net ma famille, et leur dire d'utiliser Matrix, mais je n'y publierai\njamais de donnÃ©es personnelles, photos ou quoi que ce soit, je n'ai\naucune confiance. Libre Ã  vous aussi d'utiliser plusieurs rÃ©seaux, aprÃ¨s\ntout nous jonglons dÃ©jÃ  avec plusieurs rÃ©seaux (mail, SMS, WhatsApp,\nMatrix, Twitter, Mastodon etc.), Ã§a\nn'est pas un problÃ¨me !\nPremier pas avec Matrix\nC'est parti, petit tuto Matrix. Le rÃ©seau est exceptionnel, mais le\nclient officiel (Element) est encore un peu Â«\nbrut Â» Ã  utiliser comparÃ© Ã  Signal ou WhatsApp. Notez que Ã§a Ã©volue trÃ¨s\ntrÃ¨s vite (je compte 616 contributeurs qui travaillent dessus\nbÃ©nÃ©volement, encore une grande force de l'open source !).\nCe qui va vous titiller le plus c'est : vous ne pouvez pas toujours\nidentifier vos contacts par numÃ©ro de tÃ©lÃ©phone (seulement s'ils sont\nenregistrÃ©s sur un serveur d'identitÃ©). Pourquoi ? Parce que votre\ncompte Ã  un identifiant, comme une adresse email. Le mien est\n@mnt_io:matrix.org (le format est @identifiant:serveur). C'est bien\nmeilleur pour la vie privÃ©e. Et pis, Ã§a n'est pas diffÃ©rent de MSN ou de\ntout autre rÃ©seau de l'Ã©poque, c'est vraiment WhatsApp qui a imposÃ© la Â«\ndÃ©couvertabilitÃ© Â» par le numÃ©ro de tÃ©lÃ©phone. Bien que trÃ¨s pratique,\nc'est dangereux pour la vie privÃ©e.\nDonc, go, on installe le client :\n\nsur iOS, macOS\netc.,\nsur\nAndroid,\nsur votre bureau ou votre\nnavigateur.\n\nPuis on crÃ©e un compte, et ajoutez moi. C'est parti !\nMatrix/Element est basÃ© sur les groupes. Les chats Â« directs Â» (1:1)\nsont des groupes aussi. Vous pouvez mÃªme rejoindre des rooms (gros\ngroupes, des communautÃ©s) avec des centaines voire des milliers de\npersonnes dedans. C'est trÃ¨s flexible.\nParce que c'est open source, n'importe qui peut Ã©crire son propre client\n(programme qui se connecte au rÃ©seau). Il existe des clients\nalternatives, comme Nio ou\nFluffyChat, ou mÃªme Ditto\nChat. Tous ces\nclients sont encore en beta, mais Ã§a montre un futur trÃ¨s excitant pour\nMatrix avec des clients de plus en plus aboutis !\nMatrix, Element, Vector, hein ?\n\nElement c'est le nom de l'entreprise qui travaille/dÃ©veloppe le\nrÃ©seau, les serveurs et le client ;\nMatrix c'est le nom du rÃ©seau ;\nVector, c'est l'ancien nom d'Element.\n\nOn parle souvent de faÃ§on indiffÃ©rentiÃ©e de Matrix ou Element, c'est un\nabus de langage.\n\nBefore: Mark as read.\nNow: Mark has read.\n\nEt par pitiÃ©, quittez Facebookâ¦\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-whatsapp-hello/","title":"Bye bye WhatsApp, hello ?"},"https://mnt.io/articles/control-the-terminal-the-right-way/":{"body":"Nowadays, there are plenty of terminal emulators in the wild.

Like a graphical interface,\nthere are inputs: The keyboard and the mouse, and ouputs: The screen or\na file (a real file, a socket, a FIFO, something elseâ¦).\nThere is a ton of terminals. The most famous ones are:\n\nxterm,\niTerm2,\nurxvt,\nTeraTerm.\n\nWhatever the terminal you use, inputs are handled by programs (or\nprocessus) and outputs are produced by these latters. We said outputs\ncan be the screen or a file. Actually, everything is a file, so the\nscreen is also a file. However, the user is able to use\nredirections\nto choose where the ouputs must go.\nLet's consider the echo program that prints all its options/arguments\non its output. Thus, in the following example, foobar is printed on\nthe screen:\n\nAnd in the following example, foobar is redirected to a file called\nlog:\n\nWe are also able to redirect the output to another program, like wc\nthat counts stuff:\n\nNow we know there are 7&nbsp;characters in foobarâ¦ no! echo automatically\nadds a new-line (\\n) after each line; so:\n\nThis is more correct!\nDetecting type of pipes\nInputs and outputs are called pipes. Yes, trivial, this is nothing\nmore than basic pipes!\nThere are 3&nbsp;standard pipes:\n\nSTDIN, standing for the standard input pipe,\nSTDOUT, standing for the standard output pipe and\nSTDERR, standing for the standard error pipe (also an output one).\n\nIf the output is attached to the screen, we say this is a âdirect\noutputâ. Why is it important? Because if we stylize a text, this is\nonly for the screen, not for a file. A file should receive regular\ntext, not all the decorations and styles.\nHopefully, the Hoa\\Console\\Console\nclass\nprovides the isDirect, isPipe and isRedirection static methods to\nknow whether the pipe is respectively direct, a pipe or a redirection\n(damn namingâ¦!). Thus, let Type.php be the following program:\n\nNow, let's test our program:\n\nThe first execution is very classic. STDOUT, the standard output, is\ndirect. The second execution redirects the output to another program,\nthen STDOUT is of kind pipe. Finally, the last execution redirects the\noutput to a file called /tmp/foo, so STDOUT is a redirection.\nHow does it work? We use fstat to read the\nmode of the file. The underlying fstat implementation is defined in\nC, so let's take a look at the documentation of\nfstat(2). stat is a C structure that\nlooks like:\n\nThe value of mode returned by the PHP fstat function is equal to\nst_mode in this structure. And st_mode has the following bits:\n\nAwesome, we have everything we need! We mask mode with S_IFMT to get\nthe file data. Then we just have to check whether it is a named pipe\nS_IFIFO, a character special S_IFCHR etc. Concretly:\n\nisDirect checks that the mode is equal to S_IFCHR, it means it is\nattached to the screen (in our case),\nisPipe checks that the mode is equal to S_IFIFO: This is a special\nfile that behaves like a FIFO stack (see the documentation of\nmkfifo(1)),\neverything which is written is directly read just after and the\nreading order is defined by the writing order (first-in, first-out!),\nisRedirection checks that the mode is equal to S_IFREG, S_IFDIR,\nS_IFLNK, S_IFSOCK or S_IFBLK, in other words: All kind of files\non which we can apply a redirection. Why? Because the STDOUT (or\nanother STD_*_ pipe) of the current processus is defined as a file\npointer to the redirection destination and it can be only a file, a\ndirectory, a link, a socket or a block file.\n\nI encourage you to read the implementation of the\nHoa\\Console\\Console::getMode\nmethod.\nSo yes, this is useful to enable styles on text but also to define the\ndefault verbosity level. For instance, if a program outputs the result\nof a computation with some explanations around, the highest verbosity\nlevel would output everything (the result and the explanations) while\nthe lowest level would output only the result. Let's try with the\ntoUpperCase.php program:\n\nThen, let's execute this program:\n\nAnd now, let's execute this program with a pipe:\n\nUseful and very simple, isn't it?\nTerminal capabilities\nWe can control the terminal with the inputs, like the keyboard, but we\ncan also control the outputs. How? With the text itself. Actually, an\noutput does not contain only the text but it includes control\nfunctions. It's like HTML: Around a text, you can have an element,\nspecifying that the text is a link. It's exactly the same for terminals!\nTo specify that a text must be in red, we must add a control function\naround it.\nHopefully, these control functions have been standardized in the\nECMA-48\ndocument: Control Functions for Coded Character Set. However, not all\nterminals implement all this standard, and for historical reasons, some\nterminals use slightly different control functions. Moreover, some\ninformation do not belong to this standard (because this is out of its\nscope), like: How many colours does the terminal support? or does the\nterminal support the meta key?\nConsequently, each terminal has a list of capabilities. This list is\nsplitted in 3&nbsp;categories:\n\nboolean capabilities,\nnumber capabilities,\nstring capabilities.\n\nFor instance:\n\nthe âdoes the terminal support the meta keyâ is a boolean capability\ncalled meta_key where its value is true or false,\nthe ânumber of colours supported by the terminalâ is aâ¦ number\ncapability called max_colors where its value can be 2, 8, 256\nor more,\nthe âclear screen control functionâ is a string capability called\nclear_screen where its value might be \\e[H\\e[2J,\nthe âmove the cursor one column to the rightâ is also a string\ncapability called cursor_right where its value might be \\e[C.\n\nAll the capabilities can be found in the documentation of\nterminfo(5)\nor in the documentation of\nxcurses.\nI encourage you to follow these links and see how rich the terminal\ncapabilities are!\nTerminal information\nTerminal capabilities are stored as information in databases.\nWhere are these databases located? In files with a binary format.\nFavorite locations are:\n\n/usr/share/terminfo,\n/usr/share/lib/terminfo,\n/lib/terminfo,\n/usr/lib/terminfo,\n/usr/local/share/terminfo,\n/usr/local/share/lib/terminfo,\netc.\nor the TERMINFO or TERMINFO_DIRS environment variables.\n\nInside these directories, we have a tree of the form: _xx_/_name_,\nwhere _xx_ is the ASCII value in hexadecimal of the first letter of\nthe terminal name _name_, or _n_/_name_ where _n_ is the first\nletter of the terminal name. The terminal name is stored in the TERM\nenvironment variable. For instance, on my computer:\n\nWe can use the Hoa\\Console\\Tput\nclass\nto retrieve these information. The getTerminfo static method allows to\nget the path of the terminal information file. The getTerm static\nmethod allows to get the terminal name. Finally, the whole class allows\nto parse a terminal information database (it will use the file returned\nby getTerminfo by default). For instance:\n\nOn my computer, with xterm-256color, I have 256&nbsp;colours, as expected.\nIf we parse the information of xterm and not xterm-256color, we will\nhave:\n\nThe power in your hand: Control the cursor\nLet's summarize. We are able to parse and know all the terminal\ncapabilities of a specific terminal (including the one of the current\nuser). If we would like a powerful terminal API, we need to control the\nbasis, like the cursor.\nRemember. We said that the terminal is a canvas of columns and lines.\nThe cursor is like a pen. We can move it and write something. We are\ngoing to (partly) see how the Hoa\\Console\\Cursor\nclass\nworks.\nI like to move it!\nThe moveTo static method allows to move the cursor to an absolute\nposition. For example:\n\nThe control function we use is cursor_address. So all we need to do is\nto use the Hoa\\Console\\Tput class and call the get method on it to\nget the value of this string capability. This is a parameterized one: On\nxterm-256color, its value is e[%i%p1%d;%p2%dH. We replace the\nparameters by $x and $y and we output the result. That's all! We are\nable to move the cursor on an absolute position on all terminals!\nThis is the right way to do.\nWe use the same strategy for the move static method that moves the\ncursor relatively to its current position. For example:\n\nWe split the steps and for each step we read the appropriated string\ncapability using the Hoa\\Console\\Tput class. For right, we read the\nparm_right_cursor string capability, for up, we read\nparm_up_cursor etc. Note that parm_right_cursor is different of\ncursor_right: The first one is used to move the cursor a certain\nnumber of times while the second one is used to move the cursor only one\ntime. With performances in mind, we should use the first one if we have\nto move the cursor several times.\nThe getPosition static method returns the position of the cursor. This\nway to interact is a little bit different. We must write a control\nfunction on the output, and then, the terminal replies on the input.\nSee the implementation by\nyourself.\n\nIn the same way, we have the save and restore static methods that\nsave the current position of the cursor and restore it. This is very\nuseful. We use the save_cursor and restore_cursor string\ncapabilities.\nAlso, the clear static method splits some parts to clear. For each\npart (direction or way), we read from Hoa\\Console\\Tput the\nappropriated string capabilities: clear_screen to clear all the\nscreen, clr_eol to clear everything on the right of the cursor,\nclr_eos to clear everything bellow the cursor etc.\n\nSee what we learnt in action:\n\nThe result is presented in the following figure.\n\n\n  \nSaving, moving, clearing and restoring the cursor with Hoa\\Console.\n  \n\nThe resulting API is portable, clean, simple to read and very easy to\nmaintain! This is the right way to do.\nTo get more information, please read the\ndocumentation.\nColours and decorations\nNow: Colours. This is mainly the reason why I decided to write this\narticle. We see the same and the same libraries, again and again, doing\nonly colours in the terminal, but unfortunately not in the right way ð.\nA terminal has a palette of colours. Each colour is indexed by an\ninteger, from 0 to potentially +â . The size of the palette is described\nby the max_colors number capability. Usually, a palette contains 1, 2,\n8, 256 or 16&nbsp;million colours.\n\n\n  \nThe xterm-256color palette (source).\n  \n\nSo first thing to do is to check whether we have more than 1&nbsp;colour. If\nnot, we must not colorize the given text. Next, if we have less than\n256&nbsp;colours, we have to convert the style into a palette containing\n8&nbsp;colours. Same with less than 16&nbsp;million colours, we have to convert\ninto 256&nbsp;colours.\nMoreover, we can define the style of the foreground or of the background\nwith respectively the set_a_foreground and set_a_background string\ncapabilities. Finally, in addition to colours, we can define other\ndecorations like bold, underline, blink or even inverse the foreground\nand the background colours.\nOne thing to remember is: With this capability, we only define the style\nat a given âpixelâ and it will apply on the following text. In this\ncase, it is not exactly like HTML where we have a beginning and an end.\nHere we only have a beginning. Let's try!\n\nThe API is pretty simple: We start to underline the text, we set the\nforeground to yellow and we set the background to #932e2e &nbsp;. Then we\noutput something. We continue with cancelling the underline decoration\nin addition to resetting the background. Finally we output something\nelse. Here is the result:\n\n\n  \nFun with Hoa\\Console\\Cursor::colorize.\n  \n\nWhat do we observe? My terminal does not support more than 256&nbsp;colours.\nThus, #932e2e is automatically converted into the closest colour\nin my actual palette! This is the right way to do.\nFor fun, you can change the colours in the palette with the\nHoa\\Console\\Cursor::changeColor static method. You can also change the\nstyle of the cursor, like â, _ or |.\nTo get more information, please read the\ndocumentation.\nThe power in your hand: Readline\nA more complete usage of Hoa\\Console\\Cursor and even\nHoa\\Console\\Window is the Hoa\\Console\\Readline\nclass\nthat is a powerful readline. More than autocompleters, history, key\nbindings etc., it has an advanced use of cursors. See this in action:\n\n\n  \nAn autocompletion menu, made with Hoa\\Console\\Cursor and\nHoa\\Console\\Window.\n  \n\nWe use Hoa\\Console\\Cursor to move the cursor or change the colours and\nHoa\\Console\\Window to get the dimensions of the window, scroll some\ntext in it etc. I encourage you to read the implementation.\nTo get more information, please read the\ndocumentation.\nThe power in your hand: Sound ðµ\nYes, even sound is defined by terminal capabilities. The famous bip is\ngiven by the bell string capability. You would like to make a bip?\nEasy:\n\nThat's it!\nBonus: Window\nAs a bonus, a quick demo of Hoa\\Console\\Window because it's fun.\nThe video shows the execution of the following code:\n\nWe resize the window, we get its position, we move the window on the\nscreen, we minimize and restore it, and finally we put it behind all\nother windows just before raising it.\n\nTo get more information, please read the\ndocumentation.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we saw how to control the terminal by: Firstly,\ndetecting the type of pipes, and secondly, reading and using the\nterminal capabilities. We know where these capabilities are stored and\nwe saw few of them in action.\nThis approach ensures your code will be portable, easy to maintain\nand easy to use. The portability is very important because, like\nbrowsers and user devices, we have a lot of terminal emulators released\nin the wild. We have to care about them.\nI encourage you to take a look at the Hoa\\Console\nlibrary and to contribute to make\nit even more awesome ð.\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/control-the-terminal-the-right-way/","title":"Control the terminal, the right way"},"https://mnt.io/articles/duckduckgo-in-a-shell/":{"body":"The tip\nWhen I go outside my terminal, I am kind of lost.

To write an extension, one\nneeds to develop in C or C++. The extension was simple C bindings to a\nRust library I also wrote. At that time, this Rust library was using\nwasmi for the WebAssembly VM. I\nknew that wasmi wasnât the fastest WebAssembly VM in the game, but the\nAPI is solid, well-tested, it compiles quickly, and is easy to hack. All\nthe requirements to start a project!\nAfter 6 hours of development, I got something working. I was able to run\nthe following PHP program:\n\nThe API is straightforward: create an instance (here of simple.wasm),\nthen call functions on it (here sum with 1 and 2 as arguments). PHP\nvalues are transformed into WebAssembly values automatically. For the\nrecord, here is the simple.rs Rust program that is compiled to a\nWebAssembly binary:\n\nIt was great! 6 hours is a relatively small number of hours to go that\nfar according to me.\nHowever, I quickly noticed that wasmi isâ¦ slow. One of the promise of\nWebAssembly is:\n\nWebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of\ncommon hardware\ncapabilities\navailable on a wide range of platforms.\n\nAnd clearly, my extension wasnât fulfilling this promise. Letâs see a\nbasic comparison with a benchmark.\nI chose the n-body\nalgorithm\nfrom the Computer Language Benchmarks\nGame from\nDebian, mostly because itâs relatively CPU intensive. Also, the\nalgorithm has a simple interface: based on an integer, it returns a\nfloating-point number; this API doesnât involve any advanced instance\nmemory API, which is perfect to test a proof-of-concept.\nAs a baseline, Iâve run the n-body algorithm written in\nRust,\nletâs call it rust-baseline. The same algorithm has been written in\nPHP,\nletâs call it php. Finally, the algorithm has been compiled from Rust\nto WebAssembly, and executed with the php-ext-wasm extension, letâs\ncall that case php+wasmi. All results are for nbody(5000000):\n\nrust-baseline: 287ms,\nphp: 19,761ms,\nphp+wasmi: 67,622ms.\n\nOK, soâ¦ php-ext-wasm with wasmi is 3.4 times slower than PHP\nitself, it is pointless to use WebAssembly in such conditions!\nIt confirms my first intuition though: In our case, wasmi is really\ngreat to mock something up, but itâs not fast enough for our\nexpectations.\nFaster, faster, fasterâ¦\nI wanted to use Cranelift\nsince the beginning. Itâs a code generator, Ã  la\nLLVM (excuse the brutal shortcut, the goal isnât to\nexplain what Cranelift is in details, but thatâs a really awesome\nproject!). To quote the project itself:\n\nCranelift is a low-level retargetable code generator. It translates a\ntarget-independent intermediate\nrepresentation\ninto executable machine code.\n\nIt basically means that the Cranelift API can be used to generate\nexecutable code.\nItâs perfect! I can replace wasmi by Cranelift, and boom, profit. Butâ¦\nthere is other ways to get even faster code execution â at the cost of a\nlonger code compilation though.\nFor instance, LLVM can provide a very fast code execution, almost at\nnative speed. Or we can generate assembly code dynamically. Well, there\nis multiple ways to achieve that. What if a project could provide a\nWebAssembly virtual machine with multiple backends?\nEnter Wasmer\nAnd it was at that specific time that Iâve been hired by\nWasmer. To be totally honest, I\nwas looking at Wasmer a few weeks before. It was a surprise and a great\nopportunity for me. Well, the universe really wants this rewrite from\nwasmi to Wasmer, right ð?\nWasmer is organized as a set of Rust libraries (called crates). There is\neven a wasmer-runtime-c-api crate which is a C and a C++ API on top of\nthe wasmer-runtime crate and the wasmer-runtime-core crate, i.e. it\nallows running the WebAssembly virtual machine as you want, with the\nbackend of your choice: Cranelift, LLVM, or Dynasm (at the time of\nwriting). Thatâs perfect, it removes my Rust library between the PHP\nextension and wasmi. Then php-ext-wasm is reduced to a PHP extension\nwithout any Rust code, everything goes to wasmer-runtime-c-api. Thatâs\nsad to remove Rust from this project, but it relies on more Rust code!\nCounting the time to make some patches on wasmer-runtime-c-api, Iâve\nbeen able to migrate php-ext-wasm to Wasmer in 5 days.\nBy default, php-ext-wasm uses Wasmer with the Cranelift backend, it\ndoes a great balance between compilation and execution time. It is\nreally good. Letâs run the benchmark, with the addition of\nphp+wasmer(cranelift):\n\nrust-baseline: 287ms,\nphp: 19,761ms,\nphp+wasmi: 67,622ms,\nphp+wasmer(cranelift): 2,365ms ð.\n\nFinally, the PHP extension provides a faster execution than PHP itself!\nphp+wasmer(cranelift) is 8.6 times faster than php to be exact.\nAnd it is 28.6 times faster than php+wasmi. Can we reach the\nnative speed (represented by rust-baseline here)? Itâs very likely\nwith LLVM. Thatâs for another article. Iâm super happy with Cranelift\nfor the moment. (See our previous blog post to learn how we benchmark\ndifferent backends in Wasmer, and other WebAssembly\nruntimes).\nMore Optimizations\nWasmer provides more features, like module caching. Those features are\nnow included in the PHP extension. When booting the nbody.wasm file\n(19kb), it took 4.2ms. By booting, I mean: reading the WebAssembly\nbinary from a file, parsing it, validating it, compiling it to\nexecutable code and a WebAssembly module structure.\nPHP execution model is: starts, runs, dies. Memory is freed for each\nrequest. If one wants to use php-ext-wasm, you donât really want to\npay that âbooting costâ every time.\nHopefully, wasmer-runtime-c-api now provides a module serialization\nAPI, which is integrated into the PHP extension itself. It saves the\nâbooting costâ, but it adds a âdeserialization costâ. That second cost\nis smaller, but still, we need to know it exists.\nHopefully again, Zend Engine has an API to get persistent in-memory data\nbetween PHP executions. php-ext-wasm supports that API to get\npersistent modules, et voilÃ .\nNow it takes 4.2ms for the first boot of nbody.wasm and\n0.005ms for all the next boots. Itâs 840 times faster!\nConclusion\nWasmer is a young â but mature â framework to build WebAssembly runtimes\non top of. The default backend is Cranelift, and it shows its promises:\nIt brings a correct balance between compilation time and execution time.\nwasmi has been a good companion to develop a Proof-Of-Concept. This\nlibrary has its place in other usages though, like very short-living\nWebAssembly binaries (Iâm thinking of Ethereum contracts that compile to\nWebAssembly for instance, which is one of the actual use cases). Itâs\nimportant to understand that no runtime is better than another, it\ndepends on the use case.\nThe next step is to stabilize php-ext-wasm to release a 1.0.0 version.\nSee you there!\nIf you want to follow the development, take a look at\n@wasmerio and\n@mnt_io on Twitter.\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/elephant-crab-spider-web-php-ext-wasm-migrating-from-wasmi-to-wasmer/","title":"ð+ð¦+ð¸ php-ext-wasm: Migrating from wasmi to Wasmer"},"https://mnt.io/articles/export-functions-in-php-a-la-javascript/":{"body":"Warning: This post is totally useless.

If you would like to know more about this\nproject, you can see this conference I gave at the PHPTour last week:\nTagua VM, a safe PHP virtual\nmachine.\nThe library tagua-parser is built with parser combinators. Instead of\nhaving a classical grammar, compiled to a parser, we write pure\nfunctions acting as small parsers. We then combine them together. This\npost does not explain why this is a sane approach in our context, but\nkeep in mind this is much easier to test, to maintain, and to optimise.\nBecause this project is complex enought, we are delegating the parser\ncombinator implementation to nom.\n\nnom is a parser combinators library written in Rust. Its goal is to\nprovide tools to build safe parsers without compromising the speed or\nmemory consumption. To that end, it uses extensively Rust's strong\ntyping, zero copy parsing, push streaming, pull streaming, and\nprovides macros and traits to abstract most of the error prone\nplumbing.\n\nRecently, I have been working on optimisations in the FindToken and\nFindSubstring traits from nom itself. These traits provide methods to\nfind a token (i.e. a lexeme), and to find a substring, crazy naming.\nHowever, this is not totally valid: FindToken expects to find a single\nitem (if implemented for u8, it will look for a u8 in a &amp;[u8]),\nand FindSubstring really is about finding a substring, so a token of\nany length.\nIt appeared that these methods can be optimised in some cases. Both\ndefault implementations are using Rust iterators: Regular iterator for\nFindToken, and window\niterator for\nFindSubstring, i.e. an iterator over overlapping subslices of a given\nlength.

The example is a store product (in an e-commerce\nsolution for instance), something we are likely to meet once in our\nlifetime. Our goal is to simply avoid impossible states and\ntransitions.\nI am in deep love with Type\ntheory, however I will try\nto keep the formulas away from this article to focus on the code.\nMoreover, you might be aware that the PHP runtime type system is\nsomewhat very permissive and âpoorâ (this is not a formal definition),\nhopefully some tricks can help us to express nice constraints.\nThe Product FSM\nA product in a store might have the following states:\n\nActive: Can be purchased,\nInactive: Has been cancelled or discontinued (a discontinued product\ncan no longer be purchased),\nPurchased and renewable,\nPurchased and not renewable,\nPurchased and cancellable.\n\nThe transitions between these states can be viewed as a Finite-State\nMachine (FSM).\n\n\n  \nWe read this graph as: A product is in the state A. If the purchase\naction is called, then it transitions to the state B. If the once-off    purchase action is called, then it transitions to the state C. From the\nstate B, if the renew action is called, it remains in the same state. If\nthe cancel action is called, it transitions to the D state.

However, it is tested at runtime,\nnot at compile-time, i.e. if statements are required to test if the\nstate of a product can transition into another state, or else throw an\nexception, and this is decided at runtime. Note that PHP does not really\nhave a compile-time because it is an online compiler (learn more by\nreading Tagua VM, a safe PHP virtual\nmachine,\nat slide 29). Our goal is to prevent illegal/invalid states at\nparse-/compile-time so that the PHP virtual machine, IDE or static\nanalysis tools can prove the state of a product without executing PHP\ncode.\nWhy is this important? Imagine that we decide to change a product to be\nonce-off purchasable instead of purchasable, then we can no longer renew\nit. We replace an interface on this product, and boom, the IDE tells us\nthat the code is broken in x places. It detects impossible scenarios\nahead of code execution.\nNo more talking. Here is the code.\nThe mighty product\n\nA product is a class implementing the Product interface. It allows to\ntype a generic product, with no regards about its state.\nActive and inactive\n\nThe Active and Inactive interfaces are useful to create constraints\nsuch as:\n\nA product can be purchased only if it is active, and\nA product is inactive if and only if it has been cancelled,\nTo finally conclude that an inactive product can no longer be\npurchased, nor renewed, nor cancelled.\n\nBasically, it defines the axiom (initial state) and the final states of\nour FSM.\nThe getProduct(): self trick will make sense later. It helps to\nexpress the following constraint: âA valid product cannot be invalid,\nand vice-versaâ, i.e. both interfaces cannot be implemented by the same\nvalue.\nPurchase, renew, and cancel\n\nOnly an active product can be purchased. The action is purchase and it\ngenerates a product that is renewable. purchase transitions from the\nstate A to B (regarding the graph above).\n\nOnly an active product can be cancelled. The action is cancel and it\ngenerates an inactive product, so it transitions from the state B to\nD.\n\nA renewable product is also cancellable. The action is renew and this\nis a reflexive transition from the state B to B.\n\nFinally, a once-off purchasable product has one action: purchase that\nproduces a Cancellable product, and it transitions from the state A\nto C.\nTake a breath\n\n\n\nSo far we have defined interfaces, but the FSM is not implemented yet.\nInterfaces only define constraints in our type system. An interface\nprovides a constraint but also defines type capabilities: What\noperations can be performed on a value implementing a particular\ninterface.\nSecretProduct\nLet's consider the SecretProduct as a new super secret product that\nwill revolutionise our store:\n\nThe SecretProduct is a product that is active and purchasable. PHP\nverifies that the Active::getProduct method is implemented, and that\nthe Purchasable::purchase method is implemented too.\nWhen this latter is called, it returns an object implementing the\nRenewable interface (which is also a cancellable active product). The\nobject in this context is an instance of an anonymous class implementing\nthe Renewable interface. So the Active::getProduct,\nRenewable::renew, and Cancellable::cancel methods must be\nimplemented.\nHaving an anonymous class is not required at all, this is just simpler\nfor the example. A named class may even be better from the testing point\nof view.\nNote that:\n\nThe real purchase action is performed in the constructor of the\nanonymous class: This is not a hard rule, this is just convenient; it\ncan be done in the method before returning the new instance,\nThe real renew action is performed in the renew method before\nreturning $this,\nAnd the real cancel action is performed inâ¦ we have to dig a little\nbit more (the principle is exactly the same though):\n\nThe Cancellable::cancel method must return an object implementing\nthe Inactive interface.\nIt generates an instance of an anonymous class implementing the\nInactive interface, and the real cancel action is done in the\nconstructor.\n\n\n\nAssert possible and impossible actions\nLet's try some valid and invalid actions. Those followings are\npossible actions:\n\nIt is possible to purchase a product, then renew it zero or many times,\nand finally to cancel it. It matches the FSM!\nThose followings are impossible actions:\n\nIt is impossible:\n\nTo renew or to cancel a product that has not been purchased,\nTo purchase or renew a product that has been cancelled,\nTo purchase a product more than once,\nTo cancel a product more than once.\n\nThose followings are impossible implementations:\n\nA product cannot be purchasable and once-off purchasable at the same\ntime, because Purchasable::purchase is not compatible with\nPurchasableOnce::purchase.\n\nAn inactive product cannot be purchased nor renewed nor cancelled\nbecause Active::getProduct and Inactive::getProduct are not\ncompatible.\nWow, that's great garantees isn't it? PHP will raise fatal errors for\nimpossible actions or impossible states. No warnings or notices: Fatal\nerrors. Most of them are correctly inferred by IDE, soâ¦ follow the red\ncrosses in your IDE.\nRestoring a product\nOne major thing is missing: The state of a product is stored in the\ndatabase. When loading the product, we must be able to get an instance\nof a product at its previous state. To avoid repeating code, we will use\ntraits. Rebuilding the state of a product is âjustâ (it really is) a\ncomposition of traits.\nNote: In these examples, we are using anonymous classes and traits. It\nis possible to achieve the same behavior with final named classes. Also\nwe are using a repository, which is convenient for this article, but not\nnecessarily the best solution.\nRepository\nThe following ProductRepository\\load function is just here to give you\nan idea of how it works.\n\nTraits\nThe code must look familiar because this is just a split from the\nSecretProduct implementation.\n\nAssert possible and impossible actions\nThe possible actions are:\n\nProduct 42 is assumed to be in the state B (Renewable::class), so we\ncan renew and cancel it.\nThose followings are impossible actions:\n\nIt is impossible to purchase the product 42 because it is in state B,\nso it has already been purchased. It is impossible to cancel a product\ntwice.\nSame garantees apply here!\nConclusion\nIt is possible to re-implement SecretProduct with the traits we have\ndefined for the ProductRepository, or to use named classes. I let this\nas an easy wrap up exercise for the reader.\nThe real conclusion is that we have successfully implemented the\nFinite-State Machine of a product with a Type System. It is impossible\nto have an invalid implementation that violates the constraints, such as\nan inactive renewable product. PHP detects it immediately at runtime.\nInvalid actions are also impossible, such as purchasing a product twice,\nor renewing a once-off purchased product. It is also detected by PHP.\nAll violations take the form of PHP fatal errors.\nThe product repository is an example of how to restore a product at a\nparticular state, with the help of the defined interfaces, and new small\nand simple traits.\nOne more thing\nIt is possible to integrate product categories in this type system (like\nbundles). It is more complex, but possible.\nI would highly recommend these following readings:\n\nWhat to know before debating type\nsystems\nto have an overview of different systems,\nRust's Type System is\nTuring-Complete\nto see how powerful a type system can be,\nFear Not the Machine of\nState!\nto see how to integrate an FSM into an object without using a type\nsystem.\n\nI would like to particularly emphasize a paragraph from the first\narticle:\n\nSo what is a type? The only true definition is this: a type is a\nlabel used by a type system to prove some property of the\nprogram's behavior. If the type checker can assign types to the\nwhole program, then it succeeds in its proof; otherwise it fails and\npoints out why it failed.\n\nSeeing types as labels is a very smart way of approaching them.\nI would like to thanks Marco Pivetta for\nthe reviews!\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/finite-state-machine-as-a-type-system-illustrated-with-a-store-product/","title":"Finite-State Machine as a Type System illustrated with a store product"},"https://mnt.io/articles/from-19k-to-4-2m-events-per-sec-story-of-a-sqlite-query-optimisation/":{"body":"Sit down comfortably. Take a cushion if you wish. This is, clear its\nthroat, the story of a funny performance quest. The Matrix Rust SDK is a\nset of crates aiming at providing all the necessary tooling to develop robust\nand safe Matrix clients. Of course, it involves databases to persist some\ndata. The Matrix Rust SDK supports multiple databases: in-memory, SQLite, and\nIndexedDB. This story is about the SQLite database.\nThe structure we want to persist is a novel type we have designed specifically\nfor the Matrix Rust SDK: a LinkedChunk. It's the underlying structure that\nholds all events manipulated by the Matrix Rust SDK. It is somewhat similar to\na linked list; the differences are subtle and the goal of this article is\nnot to present all the details. We have developed many API around this type\nto make all operations fast and efficient in the context of the Matrix protocol.\nWhat we need to know is that in a LinkedChunk&lt;_, Item, Gap&gt;, each node\ncontains a ChunkContent&lt;Item, Gap&gt; defined as:\n\nPut it differently: each node can contain a gap, or a set of items (be\nMatrix events).\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  May I recapitulate?\nEach Matrix room contains a LinkedChunk, which is a set of chunks. Each\nchunk is either a gap or a set of events. It seems to map fairly easily to\nSQL tables, isn't it?\n\n\nYou're right: it's pretty straightforward! Let's see the first table:\nlinked_chunks which contains all the chunks. (Note that the schemas are\nsimplified for the sake of clarity).\n\nAlrighty. Next contenders: the event_chunks and the gap_chunks tables, which\nstore the ChunkContents of each chunk, respectively for ChunkContent::Items\nand ChunkContent::Gap. In event_chunks, each row corresponds to an event. In\ngap_chunks, each row corresponds to a gap.\n\nLast contender, events. The assiduous reader may have noted that\nevent_chunks doesn't contain the content of the events: only its ID and its\nposition, roll its eyesâ¦ let's digress a bit, should we? Why is that? To\nhandle out-of-band events. In the Matrix protocol, we can receive events via:\n\nthe /sync endpoint, it's the main source of inputs, we get most\nof the events via this API,\nthe /messages endpoint, when we need to get events around\na particular events; this is helpful if we need to paginate backwards or\nforwards around an event,\nthe /context endpoint, if we need to get more context about\nan event.\nbut there is more, like pinned events, and so on.\n\nWhen an event is fetched but cannot be positioned regarding other events, it is\nconsidered out-of-band: it belongs to zero linked chunk, but we keep it in the\ndatabase. Maybe we can attach it to a linked chunk later, or we want to keep it\nfor saving future network requests. Anyway. You're a great digression companion.\nLet's jump back to our tables.\nThe events table contains all the events: in-band and out-of-band.\n\nAt some point, we need to fetch metadata about a LinkedChunk. A certain\nalgorithm needs these metadata to work efficiently. We don't need to load all\nevents, however we need:\n\nto know all the chunks that are part of a linked chunk,\nfor each chunk, the number of events: 0 in case of a ChunkContent::Gap\n(G), or the number of events in case of a ChunkContent::Items (E).\n\nA first implementation has landed in the Matrix Rust SDK. All good. When\nsuddenlyâ¦\nIncredibly slow sync\nA power-user1 was experiencing slowness. It's always\na delicate situation. How to know the reason of the slowness? Is it the device?\nThe network? The asynchronous runtime? A lock contention? The file system? â¦\nThe database?\nWe don't have the device within easy reach. Hopefully, Matrix users are always\nnice and willing to help! We have added a bunch of logs, then the user has\nreproduced the problem, and shared their logs (via a rageshake) with us. Logs are\nnever trivial to analyse. However, here is a tip we use in the Matrix Rust SDK:\nwe have a special tracing type that logs the time spent in a portion of the\ncode; called TracingTimer.\nBasically, when a TracingTimer is created, it keeps its creation time in\nmemory. And when the TracingTimer is dropped, it emits a log containing the\nelapsed time since its creation. It looks like this (it uses the tracing library):\n\nAnd with that, let's use its companion macro timer! (I won't copy-paste it\nhere, it's pretty straightforward):\n\nWith this technique, we were able to inspect the logs and saw immediately what\nwas slowâ¦ assuming we have added timer!s at the right places! It's not magic,\nit doesn't find performance issues for you. You have to probe the correct places\nin your code, and refine if necessary.\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  I don't know if you heard about sampling profilers, but those are programs\nfar superior at analysing performance problems, compared to yourâ¦ rustic\nTracingTimer (pun intended!). Such programs can provide flamegraphs, call\ntrees etc.\nI'm personally a regular user of samply, a command line CPU profiler relying\non the Firefox profiler for its UI. It works on macOS, Linux and Windows.\n\n\nI do also use samply pretty often! But you need an access to the processes\nto use such tools. Here, the Matrix Rust SDK is used and embedded inside Matrix\nclients. We have no access to it. It lives on devices everywhere around the\nworld. We may use better log analysers to infer âcall treesâ, but supporting\nasynchronous logs (because the code is asynchronous) makes it very difficult.\nAnd I honestly don't know if such a thing exists.\nSo. Yes. We found the culprit. With ripgrep, we were able to scan\nmegabytes of logs and find the culprit pretty quickly. I was looking for lags of\nthe order of a second. I wasn't disappointed:\n\n107&nbsp;seconds. Be 1&nbsp;minute and 47&nbsp;seconds. Hello sweety.\nThe slow query\nload_all_chunks_metadata is a method that runs this SQL query:\n\nFor each chunk of the linked chunk, it counts the number of events associated to\nthis chunk. That's it.\nDo you remember that a chunk can be of two kinds: ChunkContent::Items if it\ncontains a set of events, or ChunkContent::Gap if it contains a gap, so, no\nevent.\nThis query does the following:\n\nif the chunk is of kind ChunkContent::Items, it does count all events\nassociated to itself (via ec.chunk_id = lc.id),\notherwise, the chunk is of kind ChunkContent::Gap, so it will try to count\nbutâ¦ no event is associated to it: it's impossible to get ec.chunk_id = lc.id to be true for a gap. This query will scan all events for each\ngapâ¦ for no reason whatsoever! This is a linear scan here. If there are\n300&nbsp;gaps for this linked chunk, and 5000&nbsp;events, 1.5&nbsp;millions events will be\nscanned for no reason!\n\nHow lovingly inefficient.\n12.6Ã faster\nLet's use an INDEX I hear you say (let's pretend\nyou're saying that, please, for the sake of the narrative!).\nA database index provides rapid lookups after all. It has become a reflex\namongst the developer community.\n\n  \n    Le Procureur\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  Indexes are designed to quickly locate data without scanning the full table. An\nindex contains a copy of the data, organised in a way enabling very efficient\nsearch. Behind the scene, it uses various data structures, involving trade-offs\nbetween lookup performance and index size. Most of the time, an index makes it\npossible to transform a linear lookup,\n\nO(\nn\n)\n,\nto a logarithmic lookup,\n\nO(\nlog(\nn\n)\n)\n.\nSee Database index to learn more.\n\n\nThat's correct. But we didn't want to use an index here. The reason is twofold:\n\nMore spaces. Remember that Le Procureur said an index contains a copy\nof the data. Here, the data is the event ID. It's not heavy, but\nit's not nothing. Moreover, we are not counting the key to associate the\ncopied data to the row containing the real data in the source table.\nStill extra useless time. We would still need to traverse the index\nfor gaps, which is pointless. SQLite implements indexes as\nB-Trees, which is really efficient, but still, we already know\nthat a gap has zero event becauseâ¦ it'sâ¦ a gap between events!\n\nDo you remember that the linked_chunks table has a type column? It contains\nE when the chunk is of kind ChunkContent::Items âit represents a set of\neventsâ, and G when of kind ChunkContent::Gap âit represents a gapâ. Maybeâ¦ stare into the void\n\n  \n    Le Factotum\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  May I interrupt?\nDo you know that SQLite provides a CASE expression? I know it's\nunusual. SQL designers prefer to think in terms of sets, sub-sets, joins,\ntemporal tables, partial indexesâ¦ but honestly, for what I'm concerned, in\nour case, it's simple enough and it can be powerful. It's a maddeningly\npragmatic match statement.\nMoreover, the type column is already typed as an enum with the CHECK(\"type\" IN ('E', 'G')) constraint. Maybe the SQL engine can run some even smarter\noptimisations for us.\n\n\nOh, that would be brilliant! If type is E, we count the number of events,\notherwise we conclude it's de facto zero, isn't it? Let's try. The SQL query\nthen becomes:\n\nSince we have spotted the problem, we have written a benchmark to measure the\nsolutions. The benchmark simulates 10'000&nbsp;events, with 1&nbsp;gap every 80&nbsp;events.\nA set of data we consider realistic somehow for a normal user (not for a\npower-user though, because a power-user has usually more gaps than events).

In order to be complete and self-contained, I\nhave addressed all kinds of data types, including strings. This article aims at\nshowing how to generate accurate and relevant strings under several constraints.\nWhat is a regular expression?\nWe are talking about formal language theory here. In the known world,\nthere are four kinds of languages. More formally, in 1956, the Chomsky\nhierarchy has been\nformulated, classifying grammars (which define languages) in four\nlevels:\n\nunrestricted grammars, matching langages known as Turing languages,\nno restriction,\ncontext-sensitive grammars, matching contextual languages,\ncontext-free grammars, matching algebraic languages, based on\nstacked automata,\nregular grammars, matching regular languages.\n\nEach level includes the next level. The last level is the âweakerâ,\nwhich must not sound negative here. Regular\nexpressions are used\noften because of their simplicity and also because they solve most\nproblems we encounter daily.\nA regular expression is a small language with very few operators and,\nmost of the time, a simple semantics. For instance ab(c|d) means: a\nword (a data) starting by ab and followed by c or d. We also have\nquantification operators (also known as repetition operators), such as\n?, * and +. We also have {_x_,_y_} to define a repetition\nbetween _x_ and _y_. Thus, ?  is equivalent to {0,1}, * to\n{0,} and + to {1,}. When _y_ is missing, it means +â, so\nunbounded (or more exactly, bounded by the limits of the machine). So,\nfor instance ab(c|d){2,4}e? means: a word starting by ab, followed\n2, 3 or 4&nbsp;times by c or d (so cc, cd, dc, ccc, ccd, cdc\nand so on) and potentially followed by e.\nThe goal here is not to teach you regular expressions but this is kind\nof a tiny reminder. There are plenty of regular languages. You might\nknow POSIX regular\nexpression or Perl\nCompatible Regular Expressions (PCRE). Forget the\nfirst one, please. The syntax and the semantics are too much limited.\nPCRE is the regular language I recommend all the time.\nBehind every formal language there is a graph. A regular expression is compiled\ninto a Finite State Machine (FSM). I am not\ngoing to draw and explain them, but it is interesting to know that behind a\nregular expression there is a basic automaton. No magic.\nWhy focussing regular expressions?\nThis article focuses on regular languages instead of other kind of\nlanguages because we use them very often (even daily). I am going to\naddress context-free languages in another article, be patient young\npadawan. The needs and constraints with other kind of languages are not\nthe same and more complex algorithms must be involved. So we are going\neasy for the first step.\nUnderstanding PCRE: lex and parse them\nThe Hoa\\Compiler library provides\nboth LL(1) LL(k) compiler-compilers. The\ndocumentation\ndescribes how to use it. We discover that the LL(k)\ncompiler comes with a grammar description language called PP. What does\nit mean? It means for instance that the grammar of the PCRE can be\nwritten with the PP language and that Hoa\\Compiler\\Llk will transform\nthis grammar into a compiler. That's why we call them âcompiler of\ncompilersâ.\nFortunately, the Hoa\\Regex library\nprovides the grammar of the PCRE language in the\nhoa://Library/Regex/Grammar.pp\nfile. Consequently, we are able to analyze regular expressions written\nin the PCRE language! Let's try in a shell at first with the\nhoa compiler:pp tool:\n\nWe read that the whole expression is composed of a single concatenation\nof two tokens: a and b, followed by a quantification, followed by\nanother quantification. The first quantification is an alternation of (a\nchoice betwen) two tokens: c and d, between 2 to 4&nbsp;times. The second\nquantification is the e token that can appear zero or one&nbsp;time. Pretty\nsimple.\nThe final output of the Hoa\\Compiler\\Llk\\Parser class is an Abstract\nSyntax Tree (AST).\nThe documentation of Hoa\\Compiler explains all that stuff, you should read\nit. The LL(k) compiler is cut out into very distinct layers in order to improve\nhackability. Again, the documentation teach us we have four levels in the\ncompilation\nprocess:\nlexical analyzer, syntactic analyzer, trace and AST. The lexical analyzer (also\nknown as lexer) transforms the textual data being analyzed into a sequence of\ntokens (formally known as lexemes). It checks whether the data is composed of\nthe good pieces. Then, the syntactic analyzer (also known as parser) checks that\nthe order of tokens in this sequence is correct (formally we say that it derives\nthe sequence, see the Matching words\nsection\nto learn more).\nStill in the shell, we can get the result of the lexical analyzer by\nusing the --token-sequence option; thus:\n\nThis is the sequence of tokens produced by the lexical analyzer. The\ntree is not yet built because this is the first step of the compilation\nprocess. However this is always interesting to understand these\ndifferent steps and see how it works.\nNow we are able to analyze any regular expressions in the PCRE format!\nThe result of this analysis is a tree. You know what is fun with trees?\nVisiting them.\nVisiting the AST\nUnsurprisingly, each node of the AST can be visited thanks to the Hoa\\Visitor\nlibrary. Here is an example with the\nâdumpâ visitor:\n\nThis program will print the same AST dump we have previously seen in the\nshell.\nHow to write our own visitor? A visitor is a class with a single visit\nmethod. Let's try a visitor that pretty print a regular expression, i.e.\ntransform:\n\ninto:\n\nWhy a pretty printer? First, it shows how to visit a tree. Second, it\nshows the structure of the visitor: we filter by node ID (#expression,\n#quantification, token etc.) and we apply respective computations. A\npretty printer is often a good way for being familiarized with the\nstructure of an AST.\nHere is the class. It catches only useful constructions for the given\nexample:\n\nAnd finally, we apply the pretty printer on the AST like previously\nseen:\n\nEt voilÃ &nbsp;!\nNow, put all that stuff together!\nIsotropic generation\nWe can use Hoa\\Regex and Hoa\\Compiler to get the AST of any regular\nexpressions written in the PCRE format. We can use Hoa\\Visitor to\ntraverse the AST and apply computations according to the type of nodes.\nOur goal is to generate strings based on regular expressions. What kind\nof generation are we going to use? There are plenty of them: uniform\nrandom, smallest, coverage basedâ¦\nThe simplest is isotropic generation, also known as random generation.\nBut random says nothing: what is the repartition, or do we have any\nuniformity? Isotropic means each choice will be solved randomly and\nuniformly. Uniformity has to be defined: does it include the whole set\nof nodes or just the immediate children of the node? Isotropic means we\nconsider only immediate children. For instance, a node #alternation\nhas c immediate children, the probability C to choose one child is:\n\n  \n    \n      P\n      (C)\n      =\n      \n        1\n        c\n      \n    \n    P(C) = \\frac{1}{c}\n  \n\nYes, simple as that!\nWe can use the Hoa\\Math library that\nprovides the Hoa\\Math\\Sampler\\Random class to sample uniform random integers\nand floats. Ready?\nStructure of the visitor\nThe structure of the visitor is the following:\n\nWe set a sampler and we start visiting and filtering nodes by their node\nID. The following code will generate a string based on the regular\nexpression contained in the $expression variable:\n\nWe are going to change the value of $expression step by step until\nhaving ab(c|d){2,4}e?.\nCase of #expression\nA node of type #expression has only one child. Thus, we simply return\nthe computation of this node:\n\nCase of token\nWe consider only one type of token for now: literal. A literal can\ncontain an escaped character, can be a single character or can be .\n(which means everything). We consider only a single character for this\nexample (spoil: the whole visitor already exists). Thus:\n\nHere, with $expression = 'a'; we get the string a.\nCase of #concatenation\nA concatenation is just the computation of all children joined in a\nsingle piece of string. Thus:\n\nAt this step, with $expression = 'ab'; we get the string ab. Totally\ncrazy.\nCase of #alternation\nAn alternation is a choice between several children. All we have to do\nis to select a child based on the probability given above. The number of\nchildren for the current node can be known thanks to the\ngetChildrenNumber method. We are also going to use the sampler of\nintegers. Thus:\n\nNow, with $expression = 'ab(c|d)'; we get the strings abc or abd\nat random. Try several times to see by yourself.\nCase of #quantification\nA quantification is an alternation of concatenations. Indeed, e{2,4}\nis strictly equivalent to ee|eee|eeee. We have only two\nquantifications in our example: ? and {_x_,_y_}. We are going to\nfind the value for _x_ and _y_ and then choose at random between\nthese bounds. Let's go:\n\nFinally, with $expression = 'ab(c|d){2,4}e?'; we can have the\nfollowing strings: abdcce, abdc, abddcd, abcde etc. Nice isn't\nit? Want more?\n\nPerformance\nThis is difficult to give numbers because it depends of a lot of parameters:\nyour machine configuration, the PHP VM, if other programs run etc. But I have\ngenerated 1&nbsp;million strings in less than 25&nbsp;seconds on my machine (an old\nMacBook Pro), which is pretty reasonable.\nConclusion and surprise\nSo, yes, now we know how to generate strings based on regular\nexpressions! Supporting all the PCRE format is difficult. That's why the\nHoa\\Regex library provides\nthe Hoa\\Regex\\Visitor\\Isotropic class that is a more advanced visitor.\nThis latter supports classes, negative classes, ranges, all\nquantifications, all kinds of literals (characters, escaped characters,\ntypes of characters â\\w, \\d, \\hâ¦â) etc. Consequently, all you have\nto do is:\n\nThis algorithm is used in\nPraspel, a\nspecification language I have designed during my PhD thesis. More\nspecifically, this algorithm is used inside realistic domains. I am not\ngoing to explain it today but it allows me to introduce the âsurpriseâ.\nGenerate strings based on regular expressions in atoum\natoum is an awesome unit test framework. You can\nuse the Atoum\\PraspelExtension\nextension\nto use Praspel and therefore realistic domains inside atoum. You can use\nrealistic domains to validate and to generate data, they are\ndesigned for that. Obviously, we can use the Regex realistic domain.\nThis extension provides several features including sample,\nsampleMany and predicate to respectively generate one datum,\ngenerate many data and validate a datum based on a realistic domain. To\ndeclare a regular expression, we must write:\n\nAnd to generate a datum, all we have to do is:\n\nFor instance, imagine you are writing a test called test_mail and you\nneed an email address:\n\nEasy to read, fast to execute and help to focus on the logic of the test\ninstead of test data (also known as fixtures). Note that most of the\ntime the regular expressions are already in the code (maybe as\nconstants). It is therefore easier to write and to maintain the tests.\nI hope you enjoyed this first part of the series :-)! This work has been\npublished in the International Conference on Software Testing,\nVerification and Validation: Grammar-Based Testing using Realistic\nDomains in PHP.\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/generate-strings-based-on-regular-expressions/","title":"Generate strings based on regular expressions"},"https://mnt.io/articles/hello-fruux/":{"body":"Leaving the research world\nI have really enjoyed my time at INRIA and Femto-ST, 2&nbsp;research\ninstitutes in France. But after 8&nbsp;years at the university and a hard PhD\nthesis (but with great results by the way!), I would like to see other\nthings.\nMy time as an intern at Mozilla and my work in the open-source world\nhave been very seductive. Open-source contrasts a lot with the\nresearch world, where privacy and secrecy are first-citizens of every\nproject. All the work I have made and all the algorithms I have\ndeveloped during my PhD thesis have been implemented under an\nopen-source license, and I ran into some issues because of such decision\n(patents are sometimes better, sometimes notâ¦ long story).\nSo, I like research but I also like to hack and share everything. And\nright now, I have to get a change of air! So I asked on Twitter:\n\nI (Ivan Enderlin, a fresh PhD, creator of Hoa) am looking for a job.\nHere is my CV:\nhttp://t.co/dAdLm35RUu.\nPlease, contact me!\n#hoajob\nâ&nbsp;Hoa project (@hoaproject) July 24th,\n2014\n\nAnd what a surprise! A lot of companies answered to my tweet (most\nof them in private of course), but the most interesting one at my eyes\nwasâ¦ fruux&nbsp;ð.\nfruux\nfruux defines itself as: âA unified contacts/calendaring system that\nworks across platforms and\ndevices. We are behind\nsabre/dav, which is the most popular\nopen-source implementation of the\nCardDAV and\nCalDAV standards. Besides us,\ndevelopers and companies around the globe use our sabre/dav technology\nto deliver sync functionality to millions of usersâ.\n\n\n  \n  fruux's logo.\n  \n\nSeveral things attract me at fruux:\n\nlow-layers are open-source,\nviable ecosystem based on open-source,\naccepts remote working,\nclose timezone to mine,\ntouching millions of people,\nstandards in minds.\n\nThe first point is the most important for me. I don't want to make a\ncompany richer without any benefits for the rest of the world. I want my\nwork to be beneficial to the rest of the world, to share my work, I want\nmy work to be reused, hacked, criticized, updated and shared again. This\nis the spirit of the open-source and the hackability paradigms. And\nfortunately for me, fruux's low-layers are 100%&nbsp;open-source, namely\nsabre/dav &amp; co.\nHowever, being able to eat at the end of the month with open-source is\nnot that simple. Fortunately for me, fruux has a stable economic model,\nbased on open-source. Obviously, I have to work on closed projects,\nobviously, I have to work for some specific customers, but I can go back\nto open-source goodnesses all the time&nbsp;ð.\nIn addition, I am currently living in Switzerland and fruux is located\nin Germany. Fortunately for me, fruux's team is kind of dispatched all\naround Europe and the world. Naturally, they accept me to work remotely.\nWhilst it can be inconvenient for some people, I enjoy to have my own\nhours, to organize myself as I would like etc. Periodical meetings and\nphone-calls help to stay focused. And I like to think that people are\nmore productive this way. After 4&nbsp;years at home because of my Master\nthesis and PhD thesis, I know how to organize myself and exchange with a\ndecentralized team. This is a big advantage. Moreover, Germany is in the\nsame timezone as Switzerland! Compared to companies located at, for\ninstance, California, this is simpler for my family.\nFinally, working on an open-source project that is used by millions of\nusers is very motivating. You know that your contributions will touch a\nlot of people and it gives meaning to my work on a daily basis. Also,\nthe last thing I love at fruux is this desire to respect standards, RFC,\nrecommandations etc. They are involved in these processes, consortiums\nand groups (for instance\nCalConnect). I love standards and\nspecifications, and this methodology reminds me the scientific approach\nI had with my PhD thesis. I consider that a standard without an\nimplementation has no meaning, and a well-designed standard is a piece\nof a delicious cake, especially when everyone respects this standard&nbsp;ð.\n(â¦ but the cake is a lie!)\nsabre/*\nfruux has mostly hired me because of my experience on\nHoa. One of my main public job is to work on\nall the sabre/* libraries, which include:\n\nsabre/dav,\nsabre/davclient,\nsabre/event,\nsabre/http,\nsabre/proxy,\nsabre/tzserver,\nsabre/vobject,\nsabre/xml.\n\nYou will find the documentations and the news on\nsabre.io.\nAll these libraries serve the first one: sabre/dav, which is an\nimplementation of the WebDAV technology, including extensions for\nCalDAV, and CardDAV, respectively for calendars, tasks and address\nbooks. For the one who does not know what is WebDAV, in few words: The\nWeb is mostly a read-only media, but WebDAV extends HTTP in order to be\nable to write and collaborate on documents. The way WebDAV is defined is\nfascinating, and even more, the way it can be extended.\nMost of the work is already done by Evert and\nmany contributors, but we can go deeper! More extensions, more\nstandards, better code, better algorithms etc.!\nIf you are interested in the work I am doing on sabre/*, you can\ncheck this search result on\nGithub.\nFuture of Hoa\nCertain people have asked me about the future of Hoa: Whether I am going\nto stop it or not since I have a job now.\nFirstly, a PhD thesis is exhausting, and believe me, it requires more\nenergy than a regular job, even if you are passionate about your job and\nyou did not count working hours. With a PhD thesis, you have no weekend,\nno holidays, you are always out of time, you always have a ton (sic) of\narticles and documents to readâ¦ there is no break, no end. In these\nconditions, I was able to maintain Hoa and to grow the project though,\nthanks to a very helpful and present community!\nSecondly, fruux is planning to use Hoa. I don't know how or when, but if\nat a certain moment, using Hoa makes sense, they will. What does it\nimply for Hoa and me? It means that I will be paid to work on Hoa at a\nlittle percentage. I don't know how much, it will depend of the moments,\nbut this is a big step forward for the project. Moreover, a project like\nfruux using Hoa is a big chance! I hope to see the fruux's logo very\nsoon on the homepage of the Hoa's website.\nThus, to conclude, I will have more time (on evenings, weekends,\nholidays and sometimes during the day) to work on Hoa. Do not be afraid,\nthe future is bright&nbsp;ð.\nConclusion\nBref, I am working at fruux!\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/hello-fruux/","title":"Hello fruux!"},"https://mnt.io/articles/how-automattic-partly-moved-away-from-phpunit-to-atoum/":{"body":"Hello fellow developers and testers,\nFew months ago at Automattic, my team and I\nstarted a new project: Having better tests for the payment system.\nThe payment system is used by all the services at Automattic, i.e.\nWordPress,\nVaultPress, Jetpack,\nAkismet, PollDaddy etc.\nIt's a big challenge! Cherry on the cake: Our experiment could define\nthe future of the testing practices for the entire company. No pressure.\nThis post is a summary about what have been accomplished so far, the\nachievements, the failures, and the future, focused around manual tests.\nAs the title of this post suggests, we are going to talk about\nPHPUnit and atoum, which are\ntwo PHP test frameworks. This is not a PHPUnit vs. atoum fight. These\nare observations made for our software, in our context, with our\nrequirements, and our expectations. I think the discussion can be useful\nfor many projects outside Automattic. I would like to apologize in\nadvance if some parts sound too abstract, I hope you understand I can't\nreveal any details about the payment system for obvious reasons.\nWhere we were, and where to go\nFor historical reasons, WordPress, VaultPress, Jetpack &amp; siblings use\nPHPUnit for server-side manual tests. There are\nunit, integration, and system manual tests. There are also end-to-end\ntests or benchmarks, but we are not interested in them now. When those\nproducts were built, PHPUnit was the main test framework in town. Since\nthen, the test landscape has considerably changed in PHP. New\ncompetitors, like atoum or\nBehat, have a good position in the game.\nThose tests exist for many years. Some of them grew organically. PHPUnit\ndoes not require any form of structure, which is âdespite being\nquestionable according to meâ a reason for its success. It is a\nrequirement that the code does not need to be well-designed to be\ntested, but too much freedom on the test side comes with a cost in the\nlong term if there is not enough attention.\nOur situation is the following. The code is complex for justified\nreasons, and the testability is sometimes lessened. Testing across\nmany services is indubitably difficult. Some parts of the code are\nreally old, mixed with others that are new, shiny, and well-done. In\nthis context, it is really difficult to change something, especially\nmoving to another test framework. The amount of work it represents is\ncolossal. Any new test framework does not worth the price for this huge\nrefactoring. But maybe the new test frameworks can help us to better\ntest our code?\nI'm a long term contributor of\natoum (top 3\ncontributors). And at the time of writing, I'm a core member. You have\nto believe me when I say that, at each step of the discussions or the\nprocesses, I have been neutral, arguing in favor or against atoum. The\nidea to switch to atoum partly came from me actually, but my knowledge\nabout atoum is definitively a plus. I am in a good position to know the\npros and the cons of the tool, and I'm perfectly aware of how it could\nsolve issues we have.\nSo after many debates and discussions, we decided to try to move to\natoum. A survey and a meeting were scheduled 2 months later to decide\nwhether we should continue or not. Spoiler: We will partly continue with\nit.\nOur needs and requirements\nOur code is difficult to test. In other words, the testability is low\nfor some parts of the code. atoum has features to help increase the\ntestability. I will try to summarize those features in the following\nshort sections.\natoum/phpunit-extension\nAs I said, it's not possible to rewrite/migrate all the existing tests.\nThis is a colossal effort with a non-neglieable cost. Then, enter\natoum/phpunit-extension.\nAs far as I know, atoum is the only PHP framework that is able to run\ntests that have been written for another framework. The\natoum/phpunit-extension does exactly that. It runs tests written with\nthe PHPUnit API with the atoum engines. This is fabulous! PHPUnit is\nnot required at all. With this extension, we have been able to run our\nâlegacyâ (aka PHPUnit) tests with atoum. The following scenarios can be\nfulfilled:\n\nExisting test suites written with the PHPUnit API can be run\nseamlessly by atoum, no need to rewrite them,\nOf course, new test suites are written with the atoum API,\nIn case of a test suite migration from PHPUnit to atoum, there are two\nsolutions:\n\nRewrite the test suite entirely from scratch by logically using\nthe atoum API, or\nOnly change the parent class from PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase to\natoum\\phpunit\\test, and suddenly it is possible to use both API\nat the same time (and thus migrate one test case after the other\nfor instance).\n\n\n\nThis is a very valuable tool for an adventure like ours.\natoum/phpunit-extension is not perfect though. Some PHPUnit APIs are\nmissing. And while the test verdict is strictly the same, error messages\ncan be different, some PHPUnit extensions may not work properly etc.\nFortunately, our usage of PHPUnit is pretty raw: No extensions except\nhome-made ones, few hacksâ¦ Everything went well. We also have been able\nto contribute easily to the extension.\nMock engines (plural)\natoum comes with 3 mock\nengines:\n\nClass-like mock engine for classes and interfaces,\nFunction mock engine,\nConstant mock engine.\n\nBeing able to mock global functions or global constants is an important\nfeature for us. It suddenly increases the testability of our code! The\nfollowing example is fictional, but it's a good illustration. WordPress\nis full of global functions, but it is possible to mock them with atoum\nlike this:\n\nIn one line of code, it was possible to mock the\nget_userdata\nfunction.\nRunner engines\nBeing able to isolate test execution is a necessity to avoid flakey\ntests, and to increase the trust we put in the test verdicts. atoum\ncomes with de facto 3 runner engines:\n\nInline, one test case after another in the same process,\nIsolate, one test case after another but each time in a new process\n(full isolation),\nConcurrent, like isolate but tests run concurrently (âat the same\ntimeâ).\n\nI'm not saying PHPUnit doesn't have those features. It is possible to\nrun tests in a different process each time âwith the isolate engineâ,\nbut test execution time blows up, and the isolation is not strict. We\ndon't use it. The concurrent runner engine in atoum tends to reduce\nthe execution time to be close to the inline engine, while still\nensuring a strict isolation.\nFun fact: By using atoum and the atoum/phpunit-extension, we are able\nto run PHPUnit tests concurrently with a strict isolation!\nCode coverage reports\nAt the time of writing, PHPUnit is not able to generate code coverage\nreports containing the Branch- or Path Coverage Criteria data. atoum\nsupports them natively with the\natoum/reports-extension\n(including nice graphs, see the\ndemonstration). And we need those\ndata.\nThe difficulties\nOn paper, most of the pain points sound addressable. It was time to\nexperiment.\nIntegration to the Continuous Integration server\nOur CI does not natively support standard test execution report formats.\nThus we had to create the\natoum/teamcity-extension.\nLearn more by\nreading a blog post I wrote recently. The TeamCity support is native\ninside PHPUnit (see the --log-teamcity\noption).\nBootstrap test environments\nOur bootstrap files areâ¦ challenging. It's expected though. Setting up a\nfunctional test environment for a software like WordPress.com is not a\ntask one can accomplish in 2 minutes. Fortunately, we have been able to\nre-use most of the PHPUnit parts.\nToday, our unit tests run in complete isolation and concurrently. Our\nintegration tests, and system tests run in complete isolation but not\nconcurrently, due to MySQL limitations. We have solutions, but time\nneeds to be invested.\nGenerally, even if it works now, it took time to re-organize the\nbootstrap so that some parts can be shared between the test runners\n(because we didn't switch the whole company to atoum yet, it was an\nexperiment).\nDocumentation and help\nHere is an interesting paradox. The majority of the team recognized that\natoum's documentation is better than PHPUnit's, even if some parts must\nbe rewritten or reworked. But developers already know PHPUnit, so they\ndon't look at the documentation. If they have to, they will instead find\ntheir answers on StackOverflow, or by talking to someone else in the\ncompany, but not by checking the official documentation. atoum does not\nhave many StackOverflow threads, and few people are atoum users within\nthe company.\nWhat we have also observed is that when people create a new test, it's a\ncopy-paste from an existing one. Let's admit this is a common and\nnatural practice. When a difficulty is met, it's legit to look at\nsomewhere else in the test repository to check if a similar situation\nhas been resolved. In our context, that information lacked a little bit.\nWe tried to write more and more tests, but not fast enough. It should\nnot be an issue if you have time to try, but in our context, we\nunfortunately didn't have this time. The team faced many challenges in\nthe same period, and the tests we are building are not simple _Hello,\nWorld!_s as you might think, so it increases the effort.\nTo be honest, this was not the biggest difficulty, but still, it is\nimportant to notice.\nConcurrent integration test executions\nDue to some MySQL limitations combined with the complexity of our code,\nwe are not able to run integration (and system) tests concurrently yet.\nTherefore it takes time to run them, probably too much in our\ndevelopment environments. Even if atoum has friendly options to reduce\nthe debug loop (e.g. see the --loop\noption), the execution\nis still slow. The problem can be solved but it requires time, and deep\nmodifications of our code.\nNote that with our PHPUnit tests, no isolation is used. This is wrong.\nAnd thus we have a smaller trust in the test verdict than with atoum.\nAlmost everyone in the team prefers to have slow test execution but\nisolation, rather than fast test execution but no confidence in the test\nverdict. So that's partly a difficulty. It's a mix of a positive feature\nand a needle in the foot, and a needle we can live with. atoum is not\nresponsible of this latency: The state of our code is.\nThe results\nFirst, let's start by the positive impacts:\n\nIn 2 months, we have observed that the testability of our code has\nbeen increased by using atoum,\nWe have been able to find bugs in our code that were not detected by\nPHPUnit, mostly because atoum checks the type of the data,\nWe have been able to migrate âlegacy testsâ (aka PHPUnit tests) to\natoum by just moving the files from one directory to another: What a\nsmooth migration!\nThe trust we put in our test verdict has increased thanks to a\nstrict test execution isolation.\n\nNow, the negative impacts:\n\nEven if the testability has been increased, it's not enough. Right\nnow, we are looking at refactoring our code. Introducing atoum right\nnow was probably too early. Let's refactor first, then use a better\ntest toolchain later when things will be cleaner,\nMoving the whole company at once is hard. There are thousands of\nmanual tests. The atoum/phpunit-extension is not magical. We have to\ncome with more solid results, stuff to blow minds. It is necessary to\nset the institutional inertia in motion. For instance, not being able\nto run integration and system tests concurrently slows down the builds\non the CI; it increases the trust we put in the test verdict, but this\nlatency is not acceptable at the company scale,\nAll the issues we faced can be addressed, but it needs time. The\nexperiment time frame was 2 months. We need 1 or 2 other months to\nsolve the majority of the remaining issues. Note that I was kind of\nin-charge of this project, but not full time.\n\nWe stop using atoum for manual tests. It's likely to be a pause\nthough. The experiment has shown we need to refactor and clean our code,\nthen there will be a good chance for atoum to come back. The experiment\nhas also shown how to increase the testability of our code: Not\neverything can be addressed by using another test framework even if it\nlargely participates. We can focus on those points specifically, because\nwe know where they are now. Finally, I reckon it has participated in\nmoving the test infrastructure inside Automattic by showing that\nsomething else exists, and that we can go further.\nI said we stopped using atoum âfor manual testsâ. Yes. Because we also\nhave automatically generated tests. The experiment was not only about\nswitching to atoum. Many other aspects of the experiment are still\nrunning! For instance, Kitab is\nused for our code documentation. Kitab is able to (i) render the\ndocumentation, and (ii) test the examples written inside the\ndocumentation. That way the documentation is ensured to be always\nup-to-date and working. Kitab generates tests for- and executes tests\nwith atoum. It was easy to set up: We just had to use the existing test\nbootstraps designed for atoum. We also have another tool to compile\nHTTP API Blueprint specifications into executable\ntests. So far,\neveryone is happy with those tools, no need to go back, everything is\nautomat(t)ic. Other tools are likely to be introduced in the future to\nautomatically generate tests. I want to detail this particular topic in\nanother blog post.\nConclusion\nMoving to another test framework is a huge decision with many factors.\nThe fact atoum has atoum/phpunit-extension is a time saver.\nNonetheless a new test framework does not mean it will fix all the\ntestability issues of the code. The benefits of the new test framework\nmust largely overtake the costs. In our current context, it was not the\ncase. atoum solves issues that are not our priorities. So yes, atoum\ncan help us to solve important issues, but since these issues are not\npriorities, then the move to atoum was too early. During the project, we\ngained new automatic test tools, like\nKitab. The experiment is not a\nfailure. Will we retry atoum? It's very likely. When? I hope in a year.\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/how-automattic-partly-moved-away-from-phpunit-to-atoum/","title":"How Automattic (WordPress.com & co.) partly moved away from PHPUnit to atoum?"},"https://mnt.io/articles/i-leave-wasmer/":{"body":"This article could also have been titled How I failed to change\nWasmer.\nToday is my last day at Wasmer. For those who\ndon't know this name, it has a twofold meaning: it's a very popular\nWebAssembly runtime, as well as a\nstartup. I want to write about what I've been able to accomplish during\nmy time at Wasmer (a high overview, not a technical view), and what\nforces me to leave the company despite being one of its co-founder. I\nreckon my testimony can help other people to avoid digging into the hell\nI (and my colleagues) had to endure. I'm available for work, you can\ncontact me at ivan@mnt.io,\n@mnt_io,\nivan-enderlin (LinkedIn).\nFrom nothing to pure awesomeness\nI've joined the Wasmer company at its early beginning, in March 2019.\nThe company was 3 months old. My initial role was to write and to\nimprove the runtime itself, and to create many embeddings, i.e. ways to\nintegrate the Wasmer runtime inside various technologies, so that\nWebAssembly can run everywhere.\nI can say with confidence that my work is a success. I've learned a lot,\nand I've worked on so many different projects, technologies, hacked so\nmany things, collaborated with so many people, every action was led by\nthe passion.\nAt the time of writing, Wasmer has an incredible growth. In 2.5 years\nonly, the runtime has more than 10'500 stars on Github, and is one of\nthe most popular WebAssembly runtime in the world! It's used by many\nvarious companies, such as Confio, Fluence\nLabs, HOT-G,\nBrave, Google,\nApple, SpaceMesh,\nLinkerd,\nSingleStore,\nCleverCloud or\nKong to name a few (for the ones I can name\nthough, however other companies are also using Wasmer in very critical\nenvironments).\nMost of my engineering job happened on the Wasmer runtime itself. At the\ntime of writing, I'm the #2 contributor on the project. I was working\non every parts of the\nruntime:\nthe API, the C API, the compilers, the ABI (mostly WASI), the engines,\nthe middlewares, and the VM itself which is the most low-level\nfoundamental layer of the runtime.\nThe runtime provides so many features. It is an impressively powerful\nruntime for WebAssembly, and I'm saying that with a neutral and\nrespectful mindset. Not everything is perfect obviously but I did my\nbest to set up a truly user-friendly learning environment, with an\nimportant documentation and a collection of\nexamples\nthat illustrate many features. I strongly believe it contributed to\nWasmer's popularity to great extent.\nI would like to highlight the most notable embedding projects I've\ncreated:\n\nwasmer-c-api\nis the C embedding for Wasmer. It's part of the Wasmer runtime itself,\nand is fully written in Rust. The documentation, the C\nexamples,\neverything is super polished to offer the best experience possible.\nMark McCaskey and I are the authors\nof this project.\nwasmer-python is the\nPython embedding for Wasmer. At the time of writing, it's been\ninstalled more than 5 millions times (I'm counting the compiler\npackages too, like wasmer-compiler-cranelift and so on), and 1300\nstars on Github. There is about 300'000 downloads per months, and it\ncontinues to grow! The code is written in Rust, and it relies on the\nawesome pyo3 project.\nwasmer-go is the Go\nembedding for Wasmer. It's hard to know how much total downloads we\nhave because of how the Go ecosystem is designed, but we have about\n60'000 downloads per months from Github (I'm excluding the forks of\nthe project), and 1600 stars on Github. The code is written in Go and\nuses cgo to bind against the C API.\nAlmost all blockchain projects that use WebAssembly are using\nwasmer-go, which is a popularity I wasn't expecting.\nwasmer-ruby is the Ruby\nembedding for Wasmer. It's not as popular as the others, but it's also\nvery polished and it's finding its place in the Ruby ecosystem. The\ncode is written in Rust, and it relies on the awesome rutie\nproject.\nI won't detail all the projects, but there is also\nwasmer-php,\nwasmer-java,\nwasmer-postgresâ¦\nBecause of the Wasmer runtime API and C API we have designed, many\ndevelopers around the globe have been able to create a lot more\nembeddings, such as in\nC#,\nD,\nElixir,\nR,\nSwift,\nZig,\nDart,\nLisp and so on.\n\nOther fun notable projects are:\n\nsonde-rs, a library to\ncompile USDT probes into a Rust library,\nllvm-custom-builds,\na sandbox to produce custom LLVM builds for various platforms,\nloupe, a set of tools to\nanalyse and to profile Rust code,\nwasmer-interface-types,\na âlivingâ (understand an unstable playground) library that implements\nthe WebAssembly Interface Types\nproposal,\ninline-c-rs, to write and\nto execute C code inside Rust,\nin-memory filesystem, that acts exactly like std::fs.\n\nAs you might think, I've learned so much. The impostor syndrom was very\npresent because I was constantly trying to do something I didn't know.\nIt's part of the routine at Wasmer: Trying something for the first time.\nBut it's also what kept me motivated, and it was the energy for my\npassion.\nThis list above shows released projects, but I've also experimented (and\nsometimes at two hairs of a release) with:\n\nUnikernels; this one was\nreally fun, given a WebAssembly module and a filesystem, we were able\nto generate a unikernel that was executing the given program,\nParser; to write the fastest WebAssembly parser possible, it was\nworking, but never released,\nHAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) ABI for WebAssembly, so that we can\nrun WebAssembly on small chips super easily (think of IoT),\nNetworking; an extension to WASI to support networking (TCP and UDP\nsockets), with an implementation in\nRust,\nlibc, and even\nZig! We were able to compile C\nprograms to WebAssembly like cURL, or TCP servers written with kqueue\nor epoll etc, and to execute them on any platforms.\n\nAll those things were working.\nIt's absolutely crazy what WebAssembly can do today, and I still truly\nand deeply believe in this technology. I'm not the only one:\nYCombinator and\nSpeedInvest\nare also founders that believe in Wasmer.\nSo. What a dream, huh?\nThe toxic working environment\nWebAssembly is nothing without its community. I won't name people to\navoid missing important persons, but all the contributors are doing\namazing work, to create something new, something special, something\nright.\nWasmer is a success. The Wasmer runtime is nothing without the\nincredible, marvelous, exceptional team of engineers behind it. In no\nparticular order: Lachlan Sneff,\nMark McCaskey, Julien\nBianchi, Nick\nLewycky, Heyang\nZhou, Mackenzie\nClark, Brandon\nFish. All of them, with no exception, have\nput a lot of passion in this project. It is what it is today because of\nthem and also because of the contributors we have been honored to\nwelcome. The open source side of Wasmer was intense but also an\nimportant source of joy. It is a respectful place to work.\nHowever, the inside reality was very different. All the employees\nhereinabove have left the company. Almost all of them due to a burn-out\nor conflicts or strong disagreements with the company leadership. I am\nleaving due to a severe burn-out. I would like to briefly share my\njourney to my first burn-out in few points:\n\nI've started as an engineer. I love coding. I love hacking. In Wasmer,\nI've found a place to learn a lot and to express my passion. We had a\nlot of pressure mostly because our friendly âcompetitorsâ had more\npeople dedicated to work on their runtimes, more money, more power,\nbetter marketing and so on. That's the inevitable burden of any\nstartup. When you're competing against giants, that's what happens.\nAnd that's OK. It's part of the game.\nDuring that time, we were delivering more and more projects, more and\nmore features, at an incredible pace. New hats: Release manager,\nproject manager, more product ownership, more customers to be\nconnected with, more contributors to help, more issues to triage, blog\nwriter etc. The pace was accelerating too fast, something we did\nnotice on multiple occasions.\nThe CEO, Syrus Akbary, had evidently\na lot of pressure on its shoulders. It sadly resulted in the worst\npossible way: micro-management, stress, pressure, bad leadership, lack\nof vision, lack of trust in the employees, changing the roadmap\nconstantly, lies, secrets etc.\nAs one of the older in the company, with a family of two kids, I\nprobably got more âwisdomâ. I've decided to create a safe place for\nemployees to express their frustrations, their needs, to find\nsolutions together. De facto, I became the âperson of trustâ in the\ncompany. I got new hats, new pressures.\nSARS-CoV-2 hit. School at home. Lock-down. More micro-management, more\nstress. Wasmer was running out of money. I brought a new investor that\nsaved the company. New hat.\nAfter too many departures (85% of the engineering team!), I tried to\ntake more space and to take more responsabilities in the company. That\nwas at the beginning of 2021. It was my last attempt to save the\ncompany from a disaster before leaving. I couldn't imagine leaving\nsuch brilliant and successful projects without having tried everything\nI could.\nThen I became a late co-founder of Wasmer. Too many new hats:\nDoing hiring interviews, accountabilities, helping to define the\nroadmap (with another awesome person, friend, and employee), handling\nlegal aspects to hire people in multiple countries with non-precarious\ncontracts etc.\nObviously, I was also doing the job of all the engineers that have\nleft. They were not replaced for unknown reasons. It was absolutely\nmadness. The pace was unsustainable.\nFinally, the crack. The CEO continued to change the roadmap, to take\nbad decisions, to not recognize all the efforts we were doing to\nsave/grow the company. It was my turn to be declared in a severe\nburn-out by my physician. The last engineer to fall.\n\nAnother point: Syrus Akbary also has made many public errors that have\ncreated hostility against the company. Hopefully people were smart and\nkind enough to make the difference between the employees and the CEO (I\nwon't name the people but they will recognize themselves: Thank you). I\ntried to fix that situation. Discussing with dozens of person to restore\nempathy and forgiveness, to create better collaboration, to cure and\nmove forward. It was exhausting. I know people have appreciated what I\ndid, but my mental health was ruined.\nConsidering all the time I've devoted to the company, the very few\nconsideration I got in return, the countless work hours (4 days per\nweek, but frequently closing the computer at 1am due to very late\nmeetings, I was working like hell), the precarious contract I had (did\nyou ever see a co-founder with a freelancer contract?), the toxic\nworking environment, the constant pressure etc., my passion was intact\nbut my motivation was seriously damaged. Doing overtime was never\nrecorded and was happening more than frequently, but taking half a day\nto take care of a sick child was immediately counted as holidays; the\nbalance was broken. Criticisms. Micro-management. Disapprovals.\nRewriting the facts and the reality to criticize what you're doing,\nflipping things against you, avoiding discussion when things get stormy.\nWe even had a meeting titled âWhy you're not productive enoughâ whilst\neveryone was working as hell, right after the rewrite of the entire\nruntime to release Wasmer 1.0, a period we all affectionately called\nâThe Rewrite of Hellâ. The team deserved vacations, congratulations,\nattentions, gratitude, â¦ not such a shitty meeting. Well, you get the\nidea.\nWhen I've been declared in a severe burn-out, I had to take a break. The\nreaction from the CEO wasâ¦ unexpected: Zero empathy, asking to never\never being sick again (otherwise I will be fired), dividing my equities,\nasking me to work more, saying I've never been involved in the company\netc. That was the final straw to me. That's the wrong way to treat an\nemployee, a collaborator, a contributor, the co-founder.\nWhat's next?\nI need to recover. As you can imagine, working 2.5 years at this pace\nleaves sequelae. Hopefully a couple of months should suffice.\nI'm still in love with Wasmer, the runtime, the open source projects\nwe have created. It has a bright future. More companies are contributing\nto it, more individual contributors are bringing their stones to the\nmonument. The project is owned by the public, by the users, by the\ncontributors, they are doing most of the work today. It's well tested,\nwell documented, it's easy to contribute to it. It's a fabulous open\nsource piece of technology.\nI strongly hope Wasmer, the company, will change. The products\nthat are going to be released are absolutely fantastic. It's a\ntechnology shift. It will enable the Decentralized Web, how we compile\nand distribute programs, how we will even consume programs. Wasmer has a\nsolid bright future. I really hope things will change, and I wish the\nbest to and am passing on the torch to the adventurers that will\ncontinue to move the company forward. I'm just too skeptical that\nthings can improve or even slightly change. We have built something\ngreat. Please take a great care of it.\nAs I said, I'm available for a new adventure, you can contact me at\nivan@mnt.io,\n@mnt_io,\nivan-enderlin (LinkedIn).\nDiscussions on\nTwitter and on\nHackerNews.\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/i-leave-wasmer/","title":"I've loved Wasmer, I still love Wasmer"},"https://mnt.io/articles/one-conference-per-day-for-one-year-2017/":{"body":"My self-assigned challenge for 2017 was to watch at least one conference\nper day, for one year.

With an average of 34 minutes per conference, I've\nwatched 9078 minutes, or 151 hours of freely available conferences\nonline. Why did I fail to watch 365 of them? Because my first kid was\n1.5 years in January 2017, a new little lady came in December 2017, I\ngot a new\njob, I\ntravelled for my\njob, I gave\ntalks, I maintain\nimportant open source projects requiring lot of time, I'm building my\nown self-sufficient ecological house, the vegetable garden requires many\nhours, I watch other videos, and because I'm lazy sometimes.

But it has been a very enjoyable way to learn a lot in a very\nshort period of time. Many speakers are talented, and listening to them\nis a real pleasure.

It's also a good way to get\ninspired by technologies you don't necessarily know (for instance, I'm\nnot a big fan of Clojure, but some projects are really inspiring, like\nProto\nREPL).\nSometimes I tweeted about the talk I\nwatched, and it was quite appreciated too. I reckon because it's a fun\nand an easy way to learn, especially with the help of video platforms\nlike Youtube.\nAm I going to continue this challenge in 2018? Yes! But maybe not at\nthis frequency. It's now part of my routine to watch conferences many\ntimes per week. I like it.

This article, first, quickly list them and, second, ask questions\nabout how such errors can be present and how they can be easily revealed. If\nreading my dry humor about RFC errata is boring, the next sections are more\ninteresting. The whole idea is: Why RFCs do not provide executable test suites?\nWhat is xCal and xCard?\nThe Web is a read-only media. It is based on the HTTP protocol. However,\nthere is the WebDAV protocol,\nstanding for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning. This is an\nextension to HTTP. Et voilÃ &nbsp;! The Web is a read and write media.\nWebDAV is standardized in RFC2518\nand RFC4918.\nBased on WebDAV, we have CalDAV\nand CardDAV, respectively for\nreading and writing calendars and addressbooks. They are standardized in\nRFC4791,\nRFC6638 and\nRFC6352. Good! But these\nprotocols only explain how to read and write, not how to represent a\nreal calendar or an addressbook. So let's leave protocols for formats.\nThe iCalendar format\nrepresents calendar events, like events (VEVENT), tasks (VTODO),\njournal entry (VJOURNAL, very rareâ¦), free/busy time (VFREEBUSY)\netc. The vCard format represents\ncards. The formats are very similar and share a common ancestry: This is\na horrible line-, colon- and semicolon-, randomly-escaped based\nformat. For instance:\n\nHorrible, yes. You were warned. These formats are standardized in\nseveral RFCs, to list some of them:\nRFC5545,\nRFC2426 and\nRFC6350.\nThis format is impossible to read, even for a computer. That's why we\nhave jCal and jCard, which are respectively another representation of\niCalendar and vCard but in JSON. JSON is quite\npopular in the Web today, especially because it eases the manipulation\nand exchange of data in Javascript. This is just a very simple, and\nâfrom my point of viewâ human readable, serialization format. jCal and\njCard are respectively standardized in\nRFC7265 and\nRFC7095. Thus, the equivalent of\nthe previous iCalendar example in jCal is:\n\nMuch better. But this is JSON, which is a rather loose format, so we\nalso have xCal and xCard another representation of iCalendar and vCard\nbut in XML. They are standardized\nin RFC6321 and\nRFC6351. The same example in xCal\nlooks like this:\n\nMore semantics, more meaning, easier to read (from my point of view),\nnamespacesâ¦ It is very easy to embed xCal and xCard inside other XML\nformats.\nManaging all these formats is an extremely laborious task. I suggest you\nto take a look at sabre/vobject (see the\nGithub repository of\nsabre/vobject). This is a\nPHP library to manage all the weird formats. The following example shows\nhow to read from iCalendar and write to jCal and xCal:\n\nMagic when you know the complexity of these formats (in both term of\nparsing and validation)!\nList of errata\nNow, let's talk about all the errata I submited recently:\n\n4241, in\nRFC6351\n(xCard),\n4243, in\nRFC6351\n(xCard),\n4246, in\nRFC6350\n(vCard),\n4247, in\nRFC6351\n(xCard),\n4245, in\nRFC6350\n(vCard),\n4261, in\nRFC6350\n(vCard).\n\nThe 2&nbsp;last ones are reported, not yet verified.\n4241, 4243 and 4246 are just typos in examples. âjustâ is a bit of an\nunder-statement when you are reading RFCs for days straight, you have 10\nof them opened in your browser and trying to figure out how everything\nfits together and if you are doing everything correctly. Finding typos\nat that point in your process can be very confusingâ¦\n4247 is more subtle. The RFC about xCard comes with an XML\nSchema. That's\ngreat! It will help us to test our documents and see if they are valid\nor not! No? No.\nMost of the time, I try to relax and deal with the incoming problems.\nBut the date and time format in iCalendar, vCard, jCal, jCard, xCal and\nxCard can make my blood boil in a second. In what world, exactly, --10\nor ---28 is a conceivable date and time format? How long did I sleep?\nâWellâ â was I saying to myself, âdo not make a drama, we have the XML\nSchema!â. No. Because there is an error in the schema. More precisely,\nin a regular expression:\n\nDid you find the error? (\\d\\d?) is invalid, this is (\\d\\d)?. Don't\nget me wrong: Everyone makes mistakes, but not this kind of error. I\nwill explain why in the next section.\n4245 is not an editorial error but a technical one, under review.\n4261 is crazy. It deserves a whole sub-section.\nWelcome in the crazy world of date and time formats\nThere are two major popular date and time format:\nRFC2822 and ISO.8601. Examples:\n\nFri, 27 Feb 2015 16:06:58 +0100 and\n2015-02-27T16:07:16+01:00.\n\nThe second one is a good candidate for a computer representation: no\nlocale, only digits, all information are presentâ¦\nMaybe you noticed there is no link on ISO.8601. Why? Because ISO\nstandards are not free and I don't want to pay\n140â¬ to buy a\nstandardâ¦\nThe date and time format adopted by iCalendar and vCard (and the rest of\nthe family) is ISO.8601.2004. I cannot read it. However, since we said\nin xCard we have an XML Schema; we can read this (after having applied\nerratum 4247):\n\nQuestion: --10 is October or 10&nbsp;seconds?\n--10 can fit into value-date and value-time:\n\nFrom value-date, the 3rd element in the disjunction is\n--\\d\\d(\\d\\d)?, so it matches --10,\nFrom value-time, the last element in the first disjunction is\n--\\d\\d, so it matches --10.\n\nIf we have a date-and-or-time value, value-date comes first, so --10\nis always October. Nevertheless, if we have a time value, --10 is\n10&nbsp;seconds. Crazy now?\nOh, and XML has its own date and time format, which is well-defined and\nstandardized. Why should we drag this crazy format along?\nOh, and I assume every format depending on ISO.8601.2004 has this bug.\nBut I am not sure because ISO standards are not free.\nHow can RFCs have such errors?\nSo far, RFCs are textual standards. Great. But they are just text.\nWritten by humans, and thus they are subject to errors or failures. It\nis even error-prone. I do not understand: Why an RFC does not come with\nan executable test suite? I am pretty sure every reader of an RFC\nwill try to create a test suite on its own.\nI assume xCal and xCard formats are not yet very popular. Consequently,\nfew people read the RFC and tried to write an implementation. This is my\nguess. However, it does not avoid the fact an executable test suite\nshould (must?) be provided.\nHow did I find them?\nThis is how I found these errors. I wrote a test suite for xCal and\nxCard in\nsabre/vobject.\nI would love to write a test suite agnostic of the implementation, but I\nran out of time. This is basically format transformation: R:xây where R\ncan be a reflexive operator or not (depending of the versions of\niCalendar and vCard we consider).\nFor âsimpleâ errata, I found the errors by testing it manually. For\nerrata 4247 and 4261 (with the regular expressions), I found the error\nby applying the algorithms presented in Generate strings based on\nregular\nexpressions.\nConclusion\nsabre/vobject supports xCal and xCard.\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/rfcs-should-provide-executable-test-suites/","title":"RFCs should provide executable test suites"},"https://mnt.io/articles/rush-release/":{"body":"Since 2&nbsp;years, at Hoa, we are looking for the\nperfect release process. Today, we have finalized the last thing related\nto this new process: we have found a name. It is called RÃ¼sh\nRelease, standing for Rolling Ãnd ScHeduled Release.\nThe following explanations are useful from the user point of view, not\nfrom the developer point of view. It means that we do not explain all\nthe branches and the workflow between all of them. We will settle for\nthe user final impact.\nRolling Release\nOn one hand, Hoa is not and will never be finished. We will never reach\nthe âHoly 1.0 Grailâ. So, one might reckon that Hoa is rolling-released?\nLet's dive into this direction. There are plenty rolling release\ntypes out there, such\nas:\n\npartially rolling,\nfully rolling,\ntruly rolling,\npseudo-rolling,\noptionally rolling,\ncyclically rolling,\nand synonymsâ¦\n\nI am not going to explain all of them. All you need to know is that Hoa\nis partly and truly rolling released, or part- and _true-_rolling\nreleased for short. Why? Firstly, âPart-rolling project has a subset of\nsoftware packages that are not rollingâ. If we look at Hoa only, it is\nfully rolling but Hoa depends on PHP virtual machines to be executed,\nwhich are not rolling released (for the most popular ones at least).\nThus, Hoa is partly rolling released. Secondly, âTrue-rolling\n[project] are developed solely using a rolling release software\ndevelopment modelâ, which is the case of Hoa. Consequently and finally,\nthe master branch is the final public branch, it means that it\nalways contains the latest version, and users constantly fetch\nupdates from it.\nVersioning\nSounds good. On the other hand, the majority of programs that are using\nHoa use tools called dependency managers. The most popular in PHP is\nComposer. This is a fantastic tool but with a\nlittle spine that hurts us a lot: it does not support rolling release!\nMost of the time, dependency managers work with version numbers, mainly\nof the form _x_._y_._z_, with a specific semantics for _x_, _y_\nand _z_. For instance, some people have agreed about\nsemver, standing for Semantic Versioning.\nAlso, we are not extremist. We understand the challenges and the needs\nbehind versioning. So, how to mix both: rolling release and versioning?\nBefore answering this question, let's progress a little step forward and\nlearn more about an alternative versioning approach.\nScheduled-based release\nScheduled-based, also known as date-based, release allows to define\nreleases at regular periods of time. This approach is widely adopted for\nprojects that progress quickly, such as Firefox or PHP (see the PHP\nRFC: Release Process for\nexample). For Firefox, every 6&nbsp;weeks, a new version is released. Note\nthat we should say a new update to be honest: the term version has\nan unclear meaning here.\nThe scheduled-based release seems a good candidate to be mixed with\nrolling release, isn't it?\nRÃ¼sh Release\nRÃ¼sh Release is a mix between part- and true-rolling release and\nscheduled-based release. The master branch is part- and true-rolling\nrelease, but with a semi-automatically versioning:\n\neach 6&nbsp;weeks, if at least one new patch has been merged into the\nmaster, a new version is created,\nbefore 6&nbsp;weeks, if several critical or significant patches have been\napplied, a new version is created.\n\nWhat is the version format then? We have proposed _YY_{2,4}._mm_._dd_,\nstarting from 2000, our âRÃ¼sh Epochâ.\nNevertheless, we are not infallible and we can potentially break\nbackward compatibility. It never happened but we have to face it. This\nis a problem because neither the part- and true-rolling release nor the\nscheduled-based release holds the information that the backward\ncompatibility has been broken. Therefore, the master branch must have\na compatibility number _x_, starting from 1 with step of 1.\nConsequently, the new and last version format is\n_x_._Y_{2,4}._mm_._dd_. For today for instance, it is 1.14.09.15.\nWith the RÃ¼sh Release process, we can freely rolling release our\nlibraries while ensuring the safety and embracing the pros of\nversioning.\nSo, now, you will be able to change your composer.json files from:\n\nto (learn more about the tilde\noperator):\n\n\\o/\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/rush-release/","title":"RÃ¼sh Release"},"https://mnt.io/articles/sabre-katana-a-contact-calendar-task-list-and-file-server/":{"body":"\n\n  \nProject's logo.\n  \n\nWhat is it?\nsabre/katana is a contact, calendar, task list and file server. What\ndoes it mean? Assuming nowadays you have multiple devices (PC, phones,\ntablets, TVsâ¦). If you would like to get your address books, calendars,\ntask lists and files synced between all these devices from everywhere,\nyou need a server. All your devices are then considered as clients.\nBut there is an issue with the server. Most of the time, you might\nchoose Google or maybe\nApple, but one may wonder: Can we trust these\nservers? Can we give them our private data, like all our contacts, our\ncalendars, all our photosâ¦? What if you are a company or an association\nand you have sensitive data that are really private or strategic? So,\ncan you still trust them? Where the data are stored? Who can look at\nthese data? More and more, there is a huge need for âpersonalâ server.\nMoreover, servers like Google or Apple are often closed: You reach your\ndata with specific clients and they are not available in all platforms.\nThis is for strategic reasons of course. But with sabre/katana, you\nare not limited. See the above schema: Firefox&nbsp;OS can talk to iOS or\nAndroid at the same time.\nsabre/katana is this kind of server. You can install it on your\nmachine and manage users in a minute. Each user will have a collection\nof address books, calendars, task lists and files. This server can talk\nto a loong list of devices,\nmainly thanks to a scrupulous respect of industrial standards:\n\nmacOS:\n\nOS&nbsp;X 10.10 (Yosemite),\nOS&nbsp;X 10.9 (Mavericks),\nOS&nbsp;X 10.8 (Mountain Lion),\nOS&nbsp;X 10.7 (Lion),\nOS&nbsp;X 10.6 (Snow Leopard),\nOS&nbsp;X 10.5 (Leopard),\nBusyCal,\nBusyContacts,\nFantastical,\nRainlendar,\nReminderFox,\nSoHo Organizer,\nSpotlife,\nThunderbird ,\n\n\nWindows:\n\neM Client,\nMicrosoft Outlook 2013,\nMicrosoft Outlook 2010,\nMicrosoft Outlook 2007,\nMicrosoft Outlook with Bynari WebDAV Collaborator,\nMicrosoft Outlook with iCal4OL,\nRainlendar,\nReminderFox,\nThunderbird,\n\n\nLinux:\n\nEvolution,\nRainlendar,\nReminderFox,\nThunderbird,\n\n\nMobile:\n\nAndroid,\nBlackBerry 10,\nBlackBerry PlayBook,\nFirefox&nbsp;OS,\niOS&nbsp;8,\niOS&nbsp;7,\niOS&nbsp;6,\niOS&nbsp;5,\niOS&nbsp;4,\niOS&nbsp;3,\nNokia&nbsp;N9,\nSailfish.\n\n\n\nDid you find your device in this list? Probably yes ð.\nsabre/katana sits in the middle of all your devices and synced all\nyour data. Of course, it is free and open source. Go check the\nsource!\nList of features\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of features supported by sabre/katana.\nDepending whether you are a user or a developer, the features that might\ninterest you are radically not the same. I decided to show you a list\nfrom the user point of view. If you would like to get a list from the\ndeveloper point of view, please see this exhaustive list of supported\nRFC for more details.\nContacts\nAll usual fields are supported, like phone numbers, email addresses,\nURLs, birthday, ringtone, texttone, related names, postal addresses,\nnotes, HD photos etc. Of course, groups of cards are also supported.\n\n\n  \nMy card inside the native Contact application of macOS.\n  \n\n\n\n  \nMy card inside the native Contact application of Firefox&nbsp;OS.\n  \n\nMy photo is not in HD, I really have to update it!\nCards can be encoded into several formats. The most usual format is VCF.\nsabre/katana allows you to download the whole address book of a user\nas a single VCF file. You can also create, update and delete address\nbooks.\nCalendars\nA calendar is just a set of events. Each event has several properties,\nsuch as a title, a location, a date start, a date end, some notes, URLs,\nalarms etc. sabre/katana also support recurring events (âeach last\nMonday of the month, at 11amâ¦â), in addition to scheduling (see bellow).\n\n\n  \nMy calendars inside the native Calendar application of macOS.\n  \n\n\n\n  \nMy calendars inside the native Calendar application of Firefox&nbsp;OS.\n  \n\nFew words about calendar scheduling. Let's say you are organizing an\nevent, like New release (we always enjoy release day!). You would like\nto invite several people but you don't know if they could be present or\nnot. In your event, all you have to do is to add attendees. How are they\ngoing to be notified about this event? Two situations:\n\nEither attendees are registered on your sabre/katana server and\nthey will receive an invite inside their calendar application (we\ncall this iTIP),\nOr they are not registered on your server and they will receive an\nemail with the event as an attached file (we call this iMIP). All\nthey have to do is to open this event in their calendar application.\n\n\n\n  \nInvite an attendee by email because she is not registered on your\nsabre/katana server.\n  \n\nNotice the gorgeous map embedded inside the email!\nOnce they received the event, they can accept, decline or âdon't knowâ\n(they will try to be present at) the event.\n\n\n  \nReceive an invite to an event. Here: Gordon is inviting Hywan. Three\nchoices for Hywan:\n  \n\n\n\n  \nHywan has accepted the event. Here is what the event looks like. Hywan\ncan see the response of each attendees.\n  \n\n\n\n  \nGordon is even notified that Hywan has accepted the event.\n  \n\nOf course, attendees will be notified too if the event has been moved,\ncanceled, refreshed etc.\nCalendars can be encoded into several formats. The most usal format is\nICS. sabre/katana allows you to download the whole calendar of a user\nas a single ICS file. You can also create, update and delete calendars.\nTask lists\nA task list is exactly like a calendar (from a programmatically point of\nview). Instead of containg event objects, it contains todo objects.\nsabre/katana supports group of tasks, reminder, progression etc.\n\n\n  \nMy task lists inside the native Reminder application of macOS.\n  \n\nJust like calendars, task lists can be encoded into several formats,\nwhose ICS. sabre/katana allows you to download the whole task list of\na user as a single ICS file. You can also create, update and delete task\nlists.\nFiles\nFinally, sabre/katana creates a home collection per user: A personal\ndirectory that can contain files and directories andâ¦ synced between all\nyour devices (as usual ð).\nsabre/katana also creates a special directory called public/ which\nis a public directory. Every files and directories stored inside this\ndirectory are accessible to anyone that has the correct link. No listing\nis prompted to protect your public data.\nJust like contact, calendar and task list applications, you need a\nclient application to connect to your home collection on sabre/katana.\n  \n\n  \nConnect to a server with the Finder application of macOS.\n  \n\nThen, your public directory on sabre/katana will be a regular\ndirectory as every other.\n\n\n  \nList of my files, right here in the Finder application of macOS.\n  \n\nsabre/katana is able to store any kind of files. Yes, any kinds. It's\njust files. However, it white-lists the kind of files that can be showed\nin the browser. Only images, audios, videos, texts, PDF and some vendor\nformats (like Microsoft Office) are considered as safe (for the server).\nThis way, associations can share musics, videos or images, companies can\nshare PDF or Microsoft Word documents etc. Maybe in the future\nsabre/katana might white-list more formats. If a format is not\nwhite-listed, the file will be forced to download.\nHow is sabre/katana built?\nsabre/katana is based on two big and solid projects:\n\nsabre/dav,\nHoa.\n\nsabre/dav is one of the most powerful\nCardDAV,\nCalDAV and\nWebDAV framework in the planet.\nTrusted by the likes of Atmail,\nBox,\nfruux and ownCloud, it\npowers millions of users world-wide! It is written in PHP and is open\nsource.\nHoa is a modular, extensible and structured set of PHP libraries. Fun\nfact: Also open source, this project is also trusted by\nownCloud, in addition to\nMozilla, joliCode etc.\nRecently, this project has recorded more than 600,000&nbsp;downloads and the\ncommunity is about to reach 1000&nbsp;people.\nsabre/katana is then a program based on sabre/dav for the DAV part\nand Hoa for everything else, like the logic code inside the\nsabre/dav's plugins. The result is a ready-to-use server with a nice\ninterface for the administration.\nTo ensure code quality, we use atoum, a popular and\nmodern test framework for PHP. So far, sabre/dav has more than\n1000&nbsp;assertions.\nConclusion\nsabre/katana is a server for contacts, calendars, task lists and\nfiles. Everything is synced, everytime and everywhere. It perfectly\nconnects to a lot of devices on the market. Several features we need and\nuse daily have been presented. This is the easiest and a secure way to\nhost your own private data.\nGo download it!\n","id":"https://mnt.io/articles/sabre-katana-a-contact-calendar-task-list-and-file-server/","title":"sabre/katana"},"https://mnt.io/articles/sliding-sync-at-the-matrix-conference/":{"body":"Berlin. Saturday, September 21, 2024.\n10am. I was live on stage and broadcasted on Internet, to talk about\n(Simplified) Sliding Sync, the next sync mechanism for Matrix, at the first\nMatrix Conference.\nMatrix is an open network for secure, decentralised communication. It is an\nimportant technology for Internet.\nMatrix is a protocol. Everyone can implement it: either by providing its own\nserver and connect it to the federation, or by providing its own client and\nconnect it to the federation too. Nobody has a full control over the network,\nand nobody controls the clients nor the servers. And yet, end-to-end encryption\nis working, synchronisation is working, and everybody can talk to everybody,\ncommunities organize themselves, the network grows and grows.\nI am working at Element since 2&nbsp;years now. I am paid to work on the Matrix\nRust SDK, a project owned by the Matrix organisation. Everything we do is\navailable to the entire Matrix community, not only for Element. Well, this is\nthe open source world.\nMatrix previous synchronisation mechanism is slow and inefficient. To put\nMatrix on the hands of everyone for a daily pleasant usage, we have started\nto experiment with a new sync mechanism, called Sliding Sync. The MSC âwhich\nstands for Matrix Spec Changes, like RFC for exampleâ, so the MSC3575 was\nour experimental foundation to play with a new sync mechanism. After many sweat\nand tears, we ultimately found a working pattern and design that fulfill a\nlarge majority of our usecases. Along the way, the implementation inside the\nSliding Sync Proxy âa proxy that sits on the top of a homeserver1 to provide\nthis new sync mechanismâ was starting to feel really buggy and was really slow.\nIt was time to clean up everything, including the MSC.\nEnter MSC4186, which is basically Simplified Sliding Sync. We have mostly\nremoved features from MSC3575, so that the implementation on the server-side\nis much simpler and lighter. Simplified Sliding Sync is now implemented and\nenabled by default on Synapse, one of the major homeserver implementations.\nOther homeservers have implemented MSC3575 and are working on supporting\nMSC4186.\nSliding Sync has a huge impact on the overall user experience. Syncing is now\nfast and almost transparent. It also works linearly whether the user has 10\nor 10'000&nbsp;rooms.\nMy talk can be viewed here:\n\n  \n\n  \n    Video: Simplified Sliding Sync, by Ivan&nbsp;Enderlin, at the Matrix&nbsp;Conference&nbsp;2024, Berlin\n\n    Download the slides as PDF (21MiB)\n\n  \n\nOther talks\nAll the talks are available online, including talks from the public\nsector, like NATO, Sweden, French or German administrationsâ¦ I encourage you to\ncheck the list!

This talk explains\nwhy one can see an Unable To Decrypt error while trying to view a message in\nMatrix. Most problems have been solved today, but the great message about this\npresentation is to show how hard it is (was!) to provide reliable end-to-end\nencryption over a federated network. One homeserver can be overused and then\nslowed down, or a connection between two servers can be broken, or one device\nlost its connectivity because it's used in the subway, or whatever. All these\nclasses of problems are illustrated and explained. I liked it a lot because it\ngives a good sense of why end-to-end encryption is hard over a giant\ndecentralised, federated network, with encryption keys being renewed frequently,\nand how problems have been solved.\n\n  \n\n  \n    Video: Unable to decrypt this message, by Kegan&nbsp;Dougal, at the Matrix Conference 2024, Berlin\n\n    View and download the slides\n\n  \n\nNews from the Matrix Rust SDK\nStrengthening the Base: Laying the Groundwork for a more robust Rust\nSDK by Benjamin Bouvier, a good friend!

Europe has a\nfantastic rail network, and more importantly, a unique night train network!\nGoing there by plane would have generated 1'344&nbsp;kg&nbsp;CO2eq,\nbe 68% of my annual carbon budget (for a sustainable world, we should all be at\n2'000&nbsp;kg maximum). Taking the train however has generated\n6.5&nbsp;kg&nbsp;CO2eq, be 0.33% of my annual carbon budget.

The first three weeks you\nincarn a Happiness Engineer. This is part of the Happiness Rotation\nduty. This article explains why I loved it, and why I reckon you should\ndo it too.\nHappiness Engineer, really?\nDoes it sound mad as a Cheshire cat? Pretentious maybe? Actually, it's\nnot at all.\nAs a Happiness Engineer, I had to make the support. This is part of the\nHappiness Rotation: Once a year, almost everyone swaps its position to\nhelp our users. I will go back on this later.\nMy role was to make our users happy. To achieve that, I had to:\n\nMeet our users, understand who they are, what they want to achieve,\nListen to and understand their issues,\nFind a way to fix the issues.\n\nMeet the users\nI need motivations in my job. Learning who our users are, and what they\nwant to achieve, is a great motivation. After these three weeks, I know\nwhat my contributions will serve. It gives a meaning to each\ncontribution, to each day I wake up.\nEspecially in a distributed company on Internet, our users are\nworld-wide, they speak almost all the languages on Earth, they are\npresent on all continents. Their needs vary a lot, they use our\nsoftwares in ways I was not able to foresee.\nListen to, understand, and fix their issues\nWhen you are chatting with a âsupport guyâ, you cannot imagine this is a\nreal engineer. This is not a random person filling a pre-defined vague\nform somewhere where it is cheap to hire her. You will chat with someone\nvery competent. Someone that has no superior. Someone that has all the\ntools to make you happy.\nPersonally, when I started, it was the first time I was using WordPress.\nI was more novice than the user I was talking to. So how to fix it on my\nend? I had to:\n\nAsk help to the right persons,\nTherefore, meet Automatticians (people working with Automattic),\nDiscover all the interactions between them,\nUnderstand the structure of the company,\nHow to ask help, how to formulate my questions, how to reformulate the\nissues of the usersâ¦\nDiscover all the internal tools,\nTherefore, learn how the softwares work internally and together,\nDiscover the giant internal and public documentations,\nWhen needed, create bug reports or feature requests to the\nappropriated teams,\nLearn the culture of the company.\n\nThis is why it is called Welcome to Chaos. Yes, you have to learn a\nlot in three weeks, but it is extremely educative. This is like a speed\ntraining.\nHappiness\nI can ensure that when a user is grateful after you fixed its issue, the\nterm Happiness Engineer makes a lot of sense. Automattic provides a lot\nof freedom to their Happiness Engineers to make people really happy,\nboth in term of tooling or financial.\nThis is the first time I see a company that is that much generous with\nits customers.\nThanks buddy\nOf course, when embracing the chaos, you are not alone. Everyone is here\nto help you, and to answer your questions. After all, this is part of\nthe Automattic's creed (story of the\ncreed):\n\nI will never stop learning. I wonât just work on things that are\nassigned to me. I know thereâs no such thing as a status quo. I will\nbuild our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers.\nI will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and\nIâll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more\nmotivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of\nthe most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much\nas possible, because itâs the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in\na marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the\nonly way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every\nday. Given time, there is no problem thatâs insurmountable.\n\nIn addition to everyone willing to help, a buddy was assigned to me. A\nperson that helps and teaches you everytime. This is very helpful. Thank\nyou Hannah!\nHappiness Rotation\nThis experience is great. But after some time, you might forget it. So\nas a reminder, once a year, you incarn a Happiness Engineer again. This\nis part of the happiness rotation. As far as I understand, it implies\nalmost everyone in the company.\nNote: Obviously, there is permanent happiness engineers.\nConclusion\nI deeply think this approach has many advantages. Some of them are\nlisted above. It helps to understand the company, and more importantly\nthe users. The happiness rotation stresses the fact that users are\ncentral to Automattic, probably like any companies, but not with this\ncare. Remember the creed: I will build our business sustainably through\npassionate and loyal customers. To have passionate and loyal users, you\nneed to know them.\nFor me, it was a great experience.

Annotations are\nwritten in comments and borrow the XML syntax, e.g.:\n\nThe Gutenberg format provides 2 constructions: Block, and Phrase. The\nexample above contains both: There is a block wrapping a phrase. A\nphrase is basically anything that is not a block. Let's describe the\nexample:\n\nIt starts with an annotation (&lt;!-- â¦ --&gt;),\nThe wp: is mandatory to represent a Gutenberg block,\nIt is followed by a fully qualified block name, which is a pair of an\noptional namespace (here sets to ns, defaults to core) and a block\nname (here sets to block-name), separated by a slash,\nA block has optional attributes encoded as a JSON object (see RFC\n7159, Section 4, Objects),\nFinally, a block has optional children, i.e. an heterogeneous\ncollection of blocks or phrases. In the example above, there is one\nchild that is the phrase &lt;p&gt;phrase&lt;/p&gt;. And the following example\nbelow shows a block with no child:\n\n\nThe complete grammar can be found in the parser's\ndocumentation.\nFinally, the parser is used on the editor side, not on the rendering\nside. Once rendered, the blog post is a regular HTML file. Some blocks\nare dynamics though, but this is another topic.\n\n\n  \nThe logic flow of the editor (How Little Blocks\nWork).\n  \n\nThe grammar is relatively small. The challenges are however to be as\nmuch performant and memory efficient as possible on many platforms. Some\nposts can reach megabytes, and we don't want the parser to be the\nbottleneck. Even if it is used when creating the post state (cf. the\nschema above), we have measured several seconds to load some posts. Time\nduring which the user is blocked, and waits, or see an error. In other\nscenarii, we have hit memory limit of the language's virtual machines.\nHence this experimental project! The current parsers are written in\nJavaScript (with PEG.js) and in PHP (with\nphpegjs). This Rust project\nproposes a parser written in Rust, that can run in the JavaScript and in\nthe PHP virtual machines, and on many other platforms. Let's try to be\nvery performant and memory efficient!\nWhy Rust?\nThat's an excellent question! Thanks for asking. I can summarize my\nchoice with a bullet list:\n\nIt is fast, and we need speed,\nIt is memory safe, and also memory efficient,\nNo garbage collector, which simplifies memory management across\nenvironments,\nIt can expose a C API (with Foreign Function Interface,\nFFI), which eases the\nintegration into multiple environments,\nIt compiles to many\ntargets,\nBecause I love it.\n\nOne of the goal of the experimentation is to maintain a single\nimplementation (maybe the future reference implementation) with multiple\nbindings.\nThe parser\nThe parser is written in Rust. It relies on the fabulous nom\nlibrary.\n\n\n  \nnom will happily take a byte out of your files ð\n  \n\nThe source code is available in the src/ directory in the\nrepository. It is very\nsmall and fun to read.\nThe parser produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the grammar, where\nnodes of the tree are defined as:\n\nThat's all! We find again the block name, the attributes and the\nchildren, and the phrase. Block children are defined as a collection of\nnode, this is recursive. Input&lt;'a&gt; is defined as &amp;'a [u8], i.e. a\nslice of bytes.\nThe main parser entry is the root\nfunction.\nIt represents the axiom of the grammar, and is defined as:\n\nSo the parser returns a collection of nodes in the best case. Here is an\nsimple example:\n\nThe root function and the AST will be the items we are going to use\nand manipulate in the bindings. The internal items of the parser will\nstay private.\nBindings\n\n\n\nFrom now, our goal is to expose the root function and the Node enum\nin different platforms or environments.

This post will explain what ASM.js is, how to compile the parser\ninto ASM.js, and how to use the ASM.js module with Javascript in a\nbrowser. The goal is to use ASM.js as a fallback to WebAssembly when it\nis not available. I highly recommend to read the previous\nepisode\nabout WebAssembly since they have a lot in common.\nWhat is ASM.js, and why?\nThe main programming language on the Web is Javascript. Applications\nthat want to exist on the Web had to compile to Javascript, like for\nexample games. But a problem occurs: The resulting file is heavy (hence\nWebAssembly) and Javascript virtual machines have difficulties to\noptimise this particular code, resulting in slow or inefficient\nexecutions (considering the example of games). Also âin this contextâ\nJavascript is a compilation target, and as such, some language\nconstructions are useless (like eval).\nSo what if a ânewâ language can be a compilation target and still be\nexecuted by Javascript virtual machines? This is WebAssembly today, but\nin 2013, the solution was ASM.js:\n\nasm.js, a strict subset of Javascript that can be used as a\nlow-level, efficient target language for compilers. This sublanguage\neffectively describes a sandboxed virtual machine for memory-unsafe\nlanguages like C or C++. A combination of static and dynamic\nvalidation allows Javascript engines to employ an ahead-of-time (AOT)\noptimizing compilation strategy for valid asm.js code.\n\nSo an ASM.js program is a regular Javascript program. It is not a new\nlanguage but a subset of it. It can be executed by any Javascript\nvirtual machines. However, the specific usage of the magic statement\n'use asm'; instructs the virtual machine to optimise the program with\nan ASM.js âengineâ.\nASM.js introduces types by using arithmetical operators as an annotation\nsystem. For instance, x | 0 annotes x to be an integer, +x\nannotates x to be a double, and fround(x) annotates x to be a\nfloat. The following example declares a function\nfn increment(x: u32) -&gt; u32:\n\nAnother important difference is that ASM.js works by module in order to\nisolate them from Javascript. A module is a function that takes 3\narguments:\n\nstdlib, an object with references to standard library APIs,\nforeign, an object with user-defined functionalities (such as\nsending something over a WebSocket),\nheap, an array buffer representing the memory (because memory is\nmanually managed).\n\nBut it's still Javascript. So the good news is that if your virtual\nmachine has no specific optimisations for ASM.js, it is executed as any\nregular Javascript program. And if it does, then you get a pleasant\nboost.\n\n\n  \nA graph showing 3 benchmarks running against different Javascript engines:\nFirefox, Firefox + asm.js, Google, and native.\n  \n\nRemember that ASM.js has been designed to be a compilation target. So\nnormally you don't have to care about that because it is the role of the\ncompiler. The typical compilation and execution pipeline from C or C++\nto the Web looks like this:\n\n\n  \nClassical ASM.js compilation and execution pipeline from C or C++ to the Web.\n  \n\nEmscripten, as seen in the\nschema above, is a very important project in this whole evolution of the\nWeb platform. Emscripten is:\n\na toolchain for compiling to asm.js and WebAssembly, built using LLVM,\nthat lets you run C and C++ on the web at near-native speed without\nplugins.\n\nYou are very likely to see this name one day or another if you work with\nASM.js or WebAssembly.\nI will not explain deeply what ASM.js is with a lot of examples. I\nrecommend instead to read Asm.js: The Javascript Compile\nTarget by\nJohn Resig, or Big Web app? Compile\nit! by Alon Zakai.\nOur process will be different though. We will not compile our Rust code\ndirectly to ASM.js, but instead, we will compile it to WebAssembly,\nwhich in turn will be compiled into ASM.js.\nRust&nbsp;ð ASM.js\n\n\n\nThis episode will be very short, and somehow the most easiest one. To\ncompile Rust to ASM.js, you need to first compile it to WebAssembly\n(see the previous\nepisode),\nand then compile the WebAssembly binary into ASM.js.\nActually, ASM.js is mostly required when the browser does not support\nWebAssembly, like Internet Explorer. It is essentially a fallback to run\nour program on the Web.\nThe workflow is the following:\n\nCompile your Rust project into WebAssembly,\nCompile your WebAssembly binary into an ASM.js module,\nOptimise and shrink the ASM.js module.\n\nThe wasm2js tool will be your\nbest companion to compile the WebAssembly binary into an ASM.js module.\nIt is part of Binaryen project. Then, assuming we have the WebAssembly\nbinary of our program, all we have to do is:\n\nAt this step, the gutenberg_post_parser.asm.js weights 212kb. The file\ncontains ECMAScript 6 code. And remember that old browsers are\nconsidered, like Internet Explorer, so the code needs to be transformed\na little bit. To optimise and shrink the ASM.js module, we will use the\nuglify-es tool,\nlike this:\n\nJust like we did for the WebAssembly binary, we can compress the\nresulting files with gzip and\nbrotli:\n\nWe end up with the following file sizes:\n\n.asm.js: 54kb,\n.asm.js.gz: 13kb,\n.asm.js.br: 11kb.\n\nThat's again pretty small!\nWhen you think about it, this is a lot of transformations: From Rust to\nWebAssembly to Javascript/ASM.jsâ¦ The amount of tools is rather small\ncompared to the amount of work. It shows a well-designed pipeline and a\ncollaboration between many groups of people.\nAside: If you are reading this post, I assume you are developers. And as\nsuch, I'm sure you can spend hours looking at a source code like if it\nis a master painting. Did you ever wonder what a Rust program looks like\nonce compiled to Javascript? See bellow:\n\n\n  \nA Rust program compiled as WebAssembly compiled as ASM.js.\n  \n\nI like it probably too much.\nASM.js ð Javascript\nThe resulting gutenberg_post_parser.asm.js file contains a single\nfunction named GUTENBERG_POST_PARSER_ASM_MODULE which returns an\nobject pointing to 4 private functions:\n\nroot, the axiom of our grammar,\nalloc, to allocate memory,\ndealloc, to deallocate memory, and\nmemory, the memory buffer.\n\nIt sounds familiar if you have read the previous episode with\nWebAssembly.\nDon't expect root to return a full AST: It will return a pointer to\nthe memory, and the data need to be encoded and decoded, and to write\ninto and to read from the memory the same way. Yes, the same way. The\nexact same way. So the code of the boundary layer is strictly the same.\nDo you remember the Module object in our WebAssembly Javascript\nboundary? This is exactly what the GUTENBERG_POST_PARSER_ASM_MODULE\nfunction returns. You can replace Module by the returned object, et\nvoilÃ !\nThe entired code lands\nhere.\nIt completely reuses the Javascript boundary layer for WebAssembly. It\njust sets the Module differently, and it does not load the WebAssembly\nbinary. Consequently, the ASM.js boundary layer is made of 34 lines of\ncode, only ð. It compresses to 218 bytes.\nConclusion\nWe have seen that ASM.js can be fallback to WebAssembly in environments\nthat only support Javascript (like Internet Explorer), with or without\nASM.js optimisations.\nThe resulting ASM.js file and its boundary layer are quite small. By\ndesign, the ASM.js boundary layer reuses almost the entire WebAssembly\nboundary layer. Therefore there is again a tiny surface of code to\nreview and to maintain, which is helpful.\nWe have seen in the previous episode that Rust is very fast. We have\nbeen able to observe the same statement for WebAssembly compared to the\nactual Javascript parser for the Gutenberg project. However, is it still\ntrue for the ASM.js module? In this case, ASM.js is a fallback, and like\nall fallbacks, they are notably slower than the targeted\nimplementations. Let's run the same benchmark but use the Rust parser as\nan ASM.js module:\n\nDocumentJavascript parser (ms)Rust parser as an ASM.js module (ms)speedup\ndemo-post.html15.3682.718Ã 6\nshortcode-shortcomings.html31.0228.004Ã 4\nredesigning-chrome-desktop.html106.41619.223Ã 6\nweb-at-maximum-fps.html82.9227.197Ã 3\nearly-adopting-the-future.html119.88038.321Ã 3\npygmalian-raw-html.html349.07523.656Ã 15\nmoby-dick-parsed.html2,543.75361.423Ã 7\n\n  \nBenchmark between Javascript parser and Rust parser as an ASM.js module.\n  \n\nThe ASM.js module of the Rust parser is in average 6 times faster than\nthe actual Javascript implementation. The median speedup is 6. That's\nfar from the WebAssembly results, but this is a fallback, and in\naverage, it is 6 times faster, which is really great!\nSo not only the whole pipeline is safer because it starts from Rust, but\nit ends to be faster than Javascript.\nWe will see in the next episodes of this series that Rust can reach a\nlot of galaxies, and the more it travels, the more it gets interesting.\nThanks for reading!\n","id":"https://mnt.io/series/from-rust-to-beyond/the-asm-js-galaxy/","title":"The ASM.js galaxy"},"https://mnt.io/series/from-rust-to-beyond/the-c-galaxy/":{"body":"The galaxy we will explore today is the C galaxy. This post will explain\nwhat C is (shortly), how to compile any Rust program in C in theory, and\nhow to do that practically with our Rust parser from the Rust side and\nthe C side. We will also see how to test such a binding.\nWhat is C, and why?\nC is probably\nthe most used and known programming language in the world. Quoting\nWikipedia:\n\nC [â¦] is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming\nlanguage, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope\nand recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended\noperations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to\ntypical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use\nin applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language,\nincluding operating systems, as well as various application software\nfor computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.\n\n\n\n  \nDennis Ritchie, the inventor of the C language.\n  \n\nThe impact of C is probably without precedent on the progamming language\nworld. Almost everything is written in C, starting with operating\nsystems. Today, it is one of the few common denominator between any\nprograms on any systems on any machines in the world. In other words,\nbeing compatible with C opens a large door to everything. Your program\nwill be able to talk directly to any program easily.\nBecause languages like PHP or Python are written in C, in our particular\nGutenberg parser usecase, it means that the parser can be embedded and\nused by PHP or Python directly, with almost no overhead. Neat!\nRust ð C\n\n\n\nIn order to use Rust from C, one may need 2 elements:\n\nA static library (.a file),\nA header file (.h file).\n\nThe theory\nTo compile a Rust project into a static library, the crate-type\nproperty must contain the staticlib&nbsp;value. Let's edit the Cargo.toml\nfile such as:\n\nOnce cargo build --release is run, a libgutenberg_post_parser.a file\nis created in target/release/. Done. cargo and rustc make this\nstep really a doddle.\nNow the header file. It can be written manually, but it's tedious and it\ngets easily outdated. The goal is to automatically generate it. Enter\ncbindgen:\n\ncbindgen can be used to generate C bindings for Rust code. It is\ncurrently being developed to support creating bindings for\nWebRender, but has been\ndesigned to support any project.\n\nTo install cbindgen, edit your Cargo.toml file, such as:\n\nActually, cbindgen comes in 2 flavors: CLI executable, or a library. I\nprefer to use the library approach, which makes installation easier.\nNote that Cargo has been instructed to use the build.rs file to build\nthe project. This file is an appropriate place to generate the C headers\nfile with cbindgen. Let's write it!\n\nWith those information, cbindgen will scan the source code of the\nproject and will generate C headers automatically in the\ndist/gutenberg_post_parser.h&nbsp;header file. Scanning will be detailed in\na moment, but before that, let's quickly see how to control the content\nof the header file. With the code snippet above, cbindgen will look\nfor a cbindgen.toml configuration file in the CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR\ndirectory, i.e. the root of your crate. Mine looks like this:\n\nIt describes itself quite easily. The documentation details the\nconfiguration very\nwell.\ncbindgen will scan the code and will stop on structs or&nbsp;enums that\nhave the decorator #[repr(C)], #[repr(_size_)] or\n#[repr(transparent)], or functions that are marked as extern \"C\" and\nare public. So when one writes:\n\nThen cbindgen will generate this:\n\nIt works; Great!\nNote the #[no_mangle] that decorates the Rust parse function. It\ninstructs the compiler to not rename the function, so that the function\nhas the same name from the perspective of C.\nOK, that's all for the theory. Let's practise now, we have a parser to\nbind to C!\nPractise\nWe want to bind a function named parse. The function outputs an AST\nrepresenting the language being analysed. For the\nrecall, the\noriginal AST looks like this:\n\nThis AST is defined in the Rust parser. The Rust binding to C will\ntransform this AST into another set of structs and enums for C. It is\nmandatory only for types that are directly exposed to C, not internal\ntypes that Rust uses. Let's start by defining Node:\n\nSome immediate thoughts:\n\nThe structure Slice_c_char emulates Rust slices (see below),\nThe enum Option_c_char emulates Option (see below),\nThe field children has type *const c_void. It should be\n*const Vector_Node (our definition of Vector), but the definition\nof Node is based on Vector_Node and vice versa. This cyclical\ndefinition case is unsupported by cbindgen so\nfar. Soâ¦ yes, it is\ndefined as a void pointer, and will be casted later in C,\nThe fields namespace and name are originally a tuple in Rust.\nTuples have no equivalent in C with cbindgen, so two fields are used\ninstead.\n\nLet's define Slice_c_char:\n\nThis definition borrows the semantics of Rust'\nslices. The major\nbenefit is that there is no copy when binding a Rust slice to this\nstructure.\nLet's define Option_c_char:\n\nFinally, we need to define Vector_Node and our own Result for C.\nThey mimic the Rust semantics closely:\n\nAlright, all types are declared! It's time to write the parse\nfunction:\n\nThe function takes a pointer from C. It means that the data to analyse\n(i.e. the Gutenberg blog post) is allocated and owned by C: The memory\nis allocated on the C side, and Rust is only responsible of the parsing.\nThis is where Rust shines: No copy, no clone, no memory mess, only\npointers to this data will be returned to C as slices and vectors.\nThe workflow will be the following:\n\nFirst thing to do when we deal with C: Check that the pointer is not\nnull,\nReconstitute an input from the pointer with\nCStr. This\nstandard API is useful to abstract C strings from the Rust point of\nview. The difference is that a C string terminates by a NULL byte\nand has no length, while in Rust a string has a length and does not\nterminate with a NULL byte,\nRun the parser, then transform the AST into the âC ASTâ.\n\nLet's do that!\n\nOnly pointers are used in Vector_Node: Pointer to the output, and the\nlength of the output. The conversion is light.\nNow let's see the into_c function. Some parts will not be detailed;\nNot because they are difficult but because they are repetitive. The\nentire code lands\nhere.\n\nI want to show namespace for the warm-up (name, attributes and\nPhrase are very similar), and children because it deals with void.\nLet's convert ast::Node::Block.name.0 into Node::Block.namespace:\n\nPretty straightforward so far. namespace is a Slice_c_char. The\npointer is the pointer of the name.0 slice, and the length is the\nlength of the same name.0. This is the same process for other Rust\nslices.\nchildren is different though. It works in three steps:\n\nCollect all children as C AST nodes in a Rust vector,\nTransform the Rust vector into a valid Vector_Node,\nTransform the Vector_Node into a *const c_void pointer.\n\n\nStep 1 is straightforward.\nStep 2 defines what is the behavior when there is no node. In other\nwords, it defines what an empty Vector_Node is. The buffer must\ncontain a NULL raw pointer, and the length is obviously 0. Without\nthis behavior I got various segmentation fault in my code, even if I\nchecked the length before the buffer. Note that Vector_Node is\nallocated on the heap with Box::new so that the pointer can be easily\nshared with C.\nStep 3 uses the&nbsp; Box::into_raw\nfunction\nto consume the box and to return the wrapped raw pointer of the data it\nowns. Rust will not free anything here, it's our responsability (or the\nresponsability of C to be pedantic). Then the *mut Vector_Node\nreturned by Box::into_raw can be freely casted into *const c_void.\nFinally, we instruct the compiler to not drop output when it goes out\nof scope with mem::forget (at this step of the series, you are very\nlikely to know what it does).\nPersonally, I spent few hours to understand why my pointers got random\naddresses, or were pointing to a NULL data. The resulting code is\nsimple and kind of clear to read, but it wasn't obvious for me what to\ndo beforehand.\nAnd that's all for the Rust part! The next section will present the C\ncode that calls Rust, and how to compile everything all together.\nC&nbsp;ð executable\n\n\n\nNow the Rust part is ready, the C part must be written to call it.\nMinimal Working Example\nLet's do something very quick to see if it links and compiles:\n\nTo keep the code concise, I left all the error handlers out of the\nexample. The entire code lands\nhere\nif you're curious.\nWhat happens in this code? The first thing to notice is\n#include \"gutenberg_post_parser.h\" which is the header file that is\nautomatically generated by cbindgen.\nThen a filename from argv[1] is used to read a blog post to parse. The\nparse function is from Rust, just like the Result and Vector_Node\ntypes.\nThe Rust enum Result { Ok(Vector_Node), Err } is compiled to C as:\n\nNo need to say that the Rust version is easier and more compact to read,\nbut this isn't the point. To check if Result contains an Ok value or\nan Error, one has to check the tag field, like we did with\noutput.tag == Err. To get the content of the Ok, we did\noutput.ok._0 (_0 is a field from Ok_Body).\nLet's compile this with clang! We assume that\nthis code above is located in the same directory than the\ngutenberg_post_parser.h file, i.e. in a dist/ directory. Thus:\n\nAnd that's all! We end up with a gutenberg-post-parser executable that\nruns C and Rust.\nMore details\nIn the original source\ncode,\na recursive function that prints the entire AST on stdout can be\nfound, namely print (original, isn't it?). Here is some side-by-side\ncomparisons between Rust syntax and C syntax.\nThe Vector_Node struct in Rust:\n\nThe Vector_Node struct in C:\n\nSo to respectivelly read the number of nodes (length of the vector) and\nthe nodes in C, one has to write:\n\nThis is almost idiomatic C code!\nA Node is defined in C as:\n\nSo once a node is fetched, one can write the following code to detect\nits kind:\n\nLet's focus on Block for a second, and let's print the namespace and\nthe name of the block separated by a slash (/):\n\nThe special %.*s form in printf allows to print a string based on\nits length and its pointer.\nI think it is interesting to see the cast from void to Vector_Node for\nchildren. It's a single line:\n\nI think that's all for the details!\nTesting\nI reckon it is also interesting to see how to unit test C bindings\ndirectly with Rust. To emulate a C binding, first, the inputs must be in\nâC formâ, so strings must be C strings. I prefer to write a macro for\nthat:\n\nAnd second, the opposite: The parse function returns data for C, so\nthey need to be âconverted backâ to Rust. Again, I prefer to write a\nmacro for that:\n\nAll right! The final step is to write a unit test. As an example, a\nPhrase will be tested; The idea remains the same for Block but the\ncode is more concise for the former.\n\nWhat happens here? The input and output have been prepared. The\nformer is the C string \"foo\". The latter is the result of parse.\nThen there is a match to validate the form of the AST. Rust is very\nexpressive, and this test is a good illustration. The Vector_Node\nbranch is activated if and only if the length of the vector is 1, which\nis expressed with the guard if length == 1. Then the content of the\nphrase is transformed into a Rust string and compared with a regular\nassert_eq! macro.\nNote that âin this caseâ buffer is of type *const Node, so it\nrepresents the first element of the vector. If we want to access the\nnext elements, we would need to use the Vec::from_raw_parts\nfunction\nto get a proper Rust API to manipulate this vector.\nConclusion\nWe have seen that Rust can be embedded in C very easily. In this\nexample, Rust has been compiled to a static library, and a header file;\nthe former is native with Rust tooling, the latter is automatically\ngenerated with cbindgen.\nThe parser written in Rust manipulates a string allocated and owned by\nC. Rust only returns pointers (as slices) to this string back to C. Then\nC has no difficulties to read those pointers. The only tricky part is\nthat Rust allocates some data (like vectors of nodes) on the heap that C\nmust free. The âfreeâ part has been omitted from the article though: It\ndoes not represent a big challenge, and a C developer is likely to be\nused to this kind of situation.\nThe fact that Rust does not use a garbage collector makes it a perfect\ncandidate for these usecases. The story behind these bindings is\nactually all about memory: Who allocates what, and What is the form of\nthe data in memory. Rust has a #[repr(C)] decorator to instruct the\ncompiler to use a C memory layout, which makes C bindings extremely\nsimple for the developer.\nWe have also seen that the C bindings can be unit tested within Rust\nitself, and run with cargo test.\ncbindgen is a precious companion in this adventure, by automating the\nheader file generation, it reduces the update and the maintenance of the\ncode to a build.rs script.\nIn terms of performance, C should have similar results than Rust, i.e.\nextremely fast. I didn't run a benchmark to verify this statement, it's\npurely theoretical. It can be a subject for a next post!\nNow that we have successfully embedded Rust in C, a whole new world\nopens up to us!

One can invoke the script\nlike this:\n\nThe ext_skel.php script recommends to go through the following steps:\n\nRebuild the configuration of the PHP source (run ./buildconf at the\nroot of the php-src directory),\nReconfigure the build system to enable the extension, like\n./configure --enable-gutenberg_post_parser,\nBuild with make,\nDone.\n\nBut our extension is very likely to live outside the php-src tree. So\nwe will use phpize instead. phpize is an executable that comes with\nphp, php-cgi, phpdbg, php-config etc. It allows to compile\nextensions against an already compiled php binary, which is perfect in\nour case! We will use it like this :\n\nIn this post, we will not show all the edits we have done, but we will\nrather focus on the extension binding. All the sources can be found\nhere.\nShortly, here is the config.m4 file:\n\nWhat it does is basically the following:\n\nRegister the --with-gutenberg_post_parser option in the build\nsystem, and\nDeclare the static library to compile with, and the source of the\nextension itself.\n\nWe must add the libgutenberg_post_parser.a and\ngutenberg_post_parser.h files in the same directory (a symlink is\nperfect), to get a structure such as:\n\nThe core of the extension is the gutenberg_post_parser.c file. This\nfile is responsible to create the module, and to bind our Rust code to\nPHP.\nThe module, aka the extension\nAs said, we will work in the gutenberg_post_parser.c file. First,\nlet's include everything we need:\n\nThe last line includes the gutenberg_post_parser.h file generated by\nRust (more precisely, by cbindgen, if you don't remember,&nbsp;take a look\nat the previous\nepisode).\nThen, we have to decide what API we want to expose into PHP? As a\nreminder, the Rust parser produces an AST defined as:\n\nThe C variant of the AST is very similar (with more structures, but the\nidea is almost identical). So in PHP, the following structure has been\nselected:\n\nThe gutenberg_post_parse function will output an array of objects of\nkind Gutenberg_Parser_Block or Gutenberg_Parser_Phrase, i.e. our\nAST.\nSo, let's declare those classes!\nDeclare the classes\nNote: The next 4 code blocks are not the core of the post, it is just\ncode that needs to be written, you can skip it if you are not about to\nwrite a PHP extension.\n\nA class entry represents a specific class type. A handler is associated\nto a class entry. The logic is somewhat complicated. If you need more\ndetails, I recommend to read the PHP Internals\nBook.\nThen, let's create a function to instanciate those objects:\n\nThen, let's create a function to free those objects. It works in two\nsteps: Destruct the object by calling its destructor (in the user-land),\nthen free it for real (in the VM-land):\n\nThen, let's initialize the âmoduleâ, i.e. the extension. During the\ninitialisation, we will create the classes in the user-land, declare\ntheir attributes etc.\n\nIf you are still reading, first: Thank you, and second: Congrats!\nThen, there is a PHP_RINIT_FUNCTION and a PHP_MINFO_FUNCTION\nfunctions that are already generated by the ext_skel.php script. Same\nfor the module entry definition and other module configuration details.\nThe gutenberg_post_parse function\nWe will now focus on the gutenberg_post_parse PHP function. This\nfunction takes a string as a single argument&nbsp; and returns either false\nif the parsing failed, or an array of objects of kind\nGutenberg_Parser_Block or Gutenberg_Parser_Phrase otherwise. Let's\nwrite it! Notice that it is declared with the PHP_FUNCTION\nmacro.\n\nAt this step, the argument has been declared and typed as a string\n(\"s\"). The string value is in input and the string length is in\ninput_len.\nThe next step is to parse the input. (The length of the string is not\nneeded). This is where we are going to call our Rust code! Let's do\nthat:\n\nThe Result type and the parse function come from Rust. If you don't\nremember those types, please read the previous episode about the C\ngalaxy.\nZend Engine has a macro called RETURN_FALSE to returnâ¦ false! Handy\nisn't it?\nFinally, if everything went well, we get back a collection of node as a\nVector_Node type.\nThe next step is to map those Rust/C types into PHP types, i.e. an array\nof the Gutenberg classes. Let's go:\n\nDone ð! Oh waitâ¦ the into_php_objects function need to be written!\nThe into_php_objects function\nThis function is not terribly complex: It's just full of Zend Engine\nspecific API as expected. We are going to explain how to map a Block\ninto a Gutenberg_Parser_Block&nbsp;object, and to let the Phrase mapping\nto Gutenberg_Parser_Phrase for the assiduous readers. And there we go:\n\nNow let's map a block. The process is the following:\n\nAllocate PHP strings for the block namespace, and for the block\nname,\nAllocate an object,\nSet the block namespace and the block name to their respective\nobject properties,\nAllocate a PHP string for the block attributes if any,\nSet the block attributes to its respective object property,\nIf any children, initialise a new array, and call into_php_objects\nwith the child nodes and the new array,\nSet the children to its respective object property,\nFinally, add the block object inside the array to be returned.\n\n\nDo you remember that namespace, name and other similar data are of type\nSlice_c_char? It's just a structure with a pointer and a length. The\npointer points to the original input string, so that there is no copy\n(and this is the definition of a slice actually). Well, Zend Engine has\na ZVAL_STRINGL\nmacro\nthat allows to create a string from a pointer and a length, great!\nUnfortunately for us, Zend Engine does a copy behind the\nsceneâ¦\nThere is no way to keep the pointer and the length only, but it keeps\nthe number of copies small. I think it is to take the full ownership of\nthe data, which is required for the garbage collector.\n\nThe object has been instanciated with a class represented by the\ngutenberg_parser_block_class_entry.\n\nThe zval_ptr_dtor adds 1 to the reference counter. This is required\nfor the garbage collector.\n\nIt is similar to what has been done for namespace and name. Now\nlet's continue with children.\n\nFinally, add the block instance into the array to be returned:\n\nThe entire code lands\nhere.\nPHP extension ð PHP userland\nNow the extension is written, we have to compile it. That's the\nrepetitive set of commands we have shown above with phpize. Once the\nextension is compiled, the generated gutenberg_post_parser.so file\nmust be located in the extension directory. This directory can be found\nwith the following command:\n\nFor instance, in my computer, the extension directory is\n/usr/local/Cellar/php/7.2.11/pecl/20170718.\nThen, to enable the extension for a given execution, you must write:\n\nOr, to enable the extension for all executions, locate the php.ini\nfile with php --ini and edit it to add:\n\nDone!\nNow, let's use some reflection to check the extension is correctly\nloaded and handled by PHP:\n\nEverything looks good: There is one function and two classes that are\ndefined as expected. Now, let's write some PHP code for the first time\nin this blog post!\n\nIt works very well!\nConclusion\nThe journey is:\n\nA string written in PHP,\nAllocated by the Zend Engine from the Gutenberg extension,\nPassed to Rust through FFI (static library + header),\nBack to Zend Engine in the Gutenberg extension,\nTo generate PHP objects,\nThat are read by PHP.\n\nRust fits really everywhere!\nWe have seen in details how to write a real world parser in Rust, how to\nbind it to C and compile it to a static library in addition to C\nheaders, how to create a PHP extension exposing one function and two\nobjects, how to integrate the C binding into PHP, and how to use this\nextension in PHP.\nAs a reminder, the C binding is about 150 lines of code. The PHP\nextension is about 300 lines of code, but substracting âdecorationsâ\n(the boilerplate to declare and manage the extension) that are\nautomatically generated, the PHP extension reduces to about 200 lines of\ncode. Once again, I find this is a small surface of code to review\nconsidering the fact that the parser is still written in Rust, and\nmodifying the parser will not impact the bindings (except if the AST is\nupdated obviously)!\nPHP is a language with a garbage collector. It explains why all strings\nare copied, so that they are owned by PHP itself. However, the fact that\nRust does not copy any data saves memory allocations and deallocations,\nwhich is the biggest cost most of the time.\nRust also provides safety. This property can be questionned considering\nthe number of binding we are going through: Rust to C to PHP: Does it\nstill hold? From the Rust perspective, yes, but everything that happens\ninside C or PHP must be considered unsafe. A special care must be put in\nthe C binding to handle all situations.\nIs it still fast? Well, let's benchmark. I would like to remind that the\nfirst goal of this experiment was to tackle the bad performance of the\noriginal PEG.js parser. On the JavaScript ground, WASM and ASM.js have\nshown to be very much faster (see the WebAssembly\ngalaxy,\nand the ASM.js\ngalaxy).\nFor PHP, phpegjs is used: It reads\nthe grammar written for PEG.js and compiles it to PHP. Let's see how\nthey compare:\n\nDocumentPEG PHP parser (ms)Rust parser as a PHP extension (ms)speedup\ndemo-post.html30.4090.0012Ã 25341\nshortcode-shortcomings.html76.390.096Ã 796\nredesigning-chrome-desktop.html225.8240.399Ã 566\nweb-at-maximum-fps.html173.4950.275Ã 631\nearly-adopting-the-future.html280.4330.298Ã 941\npygmalian-raw-html.html377.3920.052Ã 7258\nmoby-dick-parsed.html5,437.6305.037Ã 1080\n\n  \nBenchmarks between PEG PHP parser and Rust parser as a PHP extension.\n  \n\nThe PHP extension of the Rust parser is in average 5230 times faster\nthan the actual PEG PHP implementation. The median of the speedup is\n941.\nAnother huge issue was that the PEG parser was not able to handle many\nGutenberg documents because of a memory limit. Of course, it is possible\nto grow the size of the memory, but it is not ideal. With the Rust\nparser as a PHP extension, memory stays constant and close to the size\nof the parsed document.\nI reckon we can optimise the extension further to generate an iterator\ninstead of an array. This is something I want to explore and analyse the\nimpact on the performance. The PHP Internals Book has a chapter about\nIterators.\nThanks for reading!\n","id":"https://mnt.io/series/from-rust-to-beyond/the-php-galaxy/","title":"The PHP galaxy"},"https://mnt.io/series/from-rust-to-beyond/the-webassembly-galaxy/":{"body":"The first galaxy that our Rust parser will explore is the WebAssembly\n(Wasm) galaxy. This post will explain what WebAssembly is, how to\ncompile the parser into WebAssembly, and how to use the WebAssembly\nbinary with Javascript in a browser and with NodeJS.\nWhat is WebAssembly, and why?\nIf you already know WebAssembly, you can skip this section.\nWebAssembly defines itself as:\n\nWebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a\nstack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for\ncompilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling\ndeployment on the web for client and server applications.\n\nShould I say more? Probably, yesâ¦\nWebAssembly is a new portable binary format. Languages like C, C++, or\nRust already compiles to this target. It is the spirit successor of\nASM.js. By spirit successor, I mean it is the same\npeople trying to extend the Web platform and to make the Web fast that\nare working on both technologies. They share some design concepts too,\nbut that's not really important right now.\nBefore WebAssembly, programs had to compile to Javascript in order to\nrun on the Web platform. The resulting files were most of the time\nlarge. And because the Web is a network, the files had to be downloaded,\nand it took time. WebAssembly is designed to be encoded in a size- and\nload-time efficient binary\nformat.\nWebAssembly is also faster than Javascript for many reasons. Despites\nall the crazy optimisations engineers put in the Javascript virtual\nmachines, Javascript is a weakly and dynamically typed language, which\nrequires to be interpreted. WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed\nby taking advantage of common hardware\ncapabilities.\nWebAssembly also loads faster than\nJavascript\nbecause parsing and compiling happen while the binary is streamed from\nthe network. So once the binary is entirely fetched, it is ready to run:\nNo need to wait on the parser and the compiler before running the\nprogram.\nToday, and our blog series is a perfect example of that, it is possible\nto write a Rust program, and to compile it to run on the Web platform.\nWhy? Because WebAssembly is implemented by all major\nbrowsers, and because it has been\ndesigned for the Web: To live and run on the Web platform (like a\nbrowser). But its portable aspect and its safe and sandboxed memory\ndesign make it a\ngood candidate to run outside of the Web platform (see a serverless\nWasm framework, or an\napplication container built for\nWasm).\nI think it is important to remind that WebAssembly is not here to\nreplace Javascript. It is just another technology which solves many\nproblems we can meet today, like load-time, safety, or speed.\nRust ð WebAssembly\n\n\n\nThe Rust Wasm team is a group of\npeople leading the effort of pushing Rust into WebAssembly with a set of\ntools and integrations. There is a\nbook explaining how to write a\nWebAssembly program with Rust.\nWith the Gutenberg Rust parser, I didn't use tools like\nwasm-bindgen (which is a\npure gem) when I started the project few months ago because I hit some\nlimitations. Note that some of them have been addressed since then!\nAnyway, we will do most of the work by hand, and I think this is an\nexcellent way to understand how things work in the background. When you\nare familiar with WebAssembly interactions, then wasm-bindgen is an\nexcellent tool to have within easy reach, because it abstracts all the\ninteractions and let you focus on your code logic instead.\nI would like to remind the reader that the Gutenberg Rust parser exposes\none AST, and one root function (the axiom of the grammar),\nrespectively defined as:\n\nand\n\nKnowing that, let's go!\nGeneral design\nHere is our general design or workflow:\n\nJavascript (for instance) writes the blog post to parse into the\nWebAssembly module memory,\nJavascript runs the root function by passing a pointer to the\nmemory, and the length of the blog post,\nRust reads the blog post from the memory, runs the Gutenberg parser,\ncompiles the resulting AST into a sequence of bytes, and returns the\npointer to this sequence of bytes to Javascript,\nJavascript reads the memory from the received pointer, and decodes\nthe sequence of bytes as Javascript objects in order to recreate an\nAST with a friendly API.\n\nWhy a sequence of bytes? Because WebAssembly only supports integers and\nfloats, not strings or vectors, and also because our Rust parser takes a\nslice of bytes as input, so this is handy.\nWe use the term boundary layer to refer to this Javascript piece of\ncode responsible to read from and write into the WebAssembly module\nmemory, and responsible of exposing a friendly API.\nNow, we will focus on the Rust code. It consists of only 4 functions:\n\nalloc to allocate memory (exported),\ndealloc to deallocate memory (exported),\nroot to run the parser (exported),\ninto_bytes to transform the AST into a sequence of bytes.\n\nThe entire code lands\nhere.\nIt is approximately 150 lines of code. We explain it.\nMemory allocation\nLet's start by the memory allocator. I choose to use wee_alloc for\nthe memory allocator. It is\nspecifically designed for WebAssembly by being very small (less than a\nkilobyte) and efficient.\nThe following piece of code describes the memory allocator setup and the\nâpreludeâ for our code (enabling some compiler features, like alloc,\ndeclaring external crates, some aliases, and declaring required function\nlike panic, oom etc.). This can be considered as a boilerplate:\n\nThe Rust memory is the WebAssembly memory. Rust will allocate and\ndeallocate memory on its own, but Javascript for instance needs to\nallocate and deallocate WebAssembly memory in order to\ncommunicate/exchange data. So we need to export one function to allocate\nmemory and one function to deallocate memory.\nOnce again, this is almost a boilerplate. The alloc function creates\nan empty vector of a specific capacity (because it is a linear segment\nof memory), and returns a pointer to this empty vector:\n\nNote the #[no_mangle] attribute that instructs the Rust compiler to\nnot mangle the function name, i.e. to not rename it. And extern \"C\" to\nexport the function in the WebAssembly module, so it is âpublicâ from\noutside the WebAssembly binary.\nThe code is pretty straightforward and matches what we announced\nearlier: A Vec is allocated with a specific capacity, and the pointer\nto this vector is returned. The important part is mem::forget(buffer).\nIt is required so that Rust will not deallocate the vector once it\ngoes out of scope. Indeed, Rust enforces Resource Acquisition Is\nInitialization\n(RAII),\nso whenever an object goes out of scope, its destructor is called and\nits owned resources are freed. This behavior shields against resource\nleaks bugs, and this is why we will never have to manually free memory\nor worry about memory leaks in Rust (see some RAII\nexamples).\nIn this case, we want to allocate and keep the allocation after the\nfunction execution, hence the mem::forget\ncall.\nLet's jump on the dealloc function. The goal is to recreate a vector\nbased on a pointer and a capacity, and to let Rust drops it:\n\nThe Vec::from_raw_parts\nfunction\nis marked as unsafe, so we need to delimit it in an unsafe block so\nthat the dealloc function is considered as safe.\nThe variable _ contains our data to deallocate, and it goes out of\nscope immediately, so Rust drops it.\nFrom input to a flat AST\nNow the core of the binding! The root function reads the blog post to\nparse based on a pointer and a length, then it parses it. If the result\nis OK, it serializes the AST into a sequence of bytes, i.e. it flatten\nit, otherwise it returns an empty sequence of bytes.\n\n\n  \nThe image illustrates the flow of the data: first off there is a blog post;\nsecond there is the AST of the blog post; finally there is a linear byte-encoded\nrepresentation of the AST of the blog post.\n  \n\nThe logic flow of the parser: The input on the left is parsed into an\nAST, which is serialized into a flat sequence of bytes on the right.\n\nThe variable input contains the blog post. It is fetched from memory\nwith a pointer and a length. The variable output is the sequence of\nbytes the function will return. gutenberg_post_parser::root(input)\nruns the parser. If parsing is OK, then the nodes are compiled into a\nsequence of bytes (omitted for now). Then the pointer to the sequence of\nbytes is grabbed, the Rust compiler is instructed to not drop it, and\nfinally the pointer is returned. The logic is again pretty\nstraightforward.\nNow, let's focus on the AST to the sequence of bytes (u8) compilation.\nAll data the AST hold are already bytes, which makes the process easier.\nThe goal is only to flatten the AST:\n\nThe first 4 bytes represent the number of nodes at the first level (4\nÃ u8 represents u32) ,\nNext, if the node is Block:\n\nThe first byte is the node type: 1u8 for a block,\nThe second byte is the size of the block name,\nThe third to the sixth bytes are the size of the attributes,\nThe seventh byte is the number of node children the block has,\nNext bytes are the block name,\nNext bytes are the attributes (&amp;b\"null\"[..] if none),\nNext bytes are node children as a sequence of bytes,\n\n\nNext, if the node is Phrase:\n\nThe first byte is the node type: 2u8 for a phrase,\nThe second to the fifth bytes are the size of the phrase,\nNext bytes are the phrase.\n\n\n\nHere is the missing part of the root function:\n\nAnd here is the into_bytes function:\n\nWhat I find interesting with this code is it reads just like the bullet\nlist above the code.\nFor the most curious, here is the u32_to_u8s function:\n\nHere we are. alloc, dealloc, root, and into_bytes. Four\nfunctions, and everything is done.\nProducing and optimising the WebAssembly binary\nTo get a WebAssembly binary, the project has to be compiled to the\nwasm32-unknown-unknown target. For now (and it will change in a near\nfuture), the nightly toolchain is needed to compile the project, so make\nsure you have the latest nightly version of rustc &amp; co. installed with\nrustup update nightly. Let's run cargo:\n\nThe WebAssembly binary weights 22kb. Our goal is to reduce the file\nsize. For that, the following tools will be required:\n\nwasm-gc to\ngarbage-collect unused imports, internal functions, types etc.,\nwasm-snip to mark some\nfunctions as unreachable, this is useful when the binary includes\nunused code that the linker were not able to remove,\nwasm-opt from the Binaryen\nproject, to optimise the\nbinary,\ngzip and\nbrotli to compress the binary.\n\nBasically, what we do is the following:\n\nWe end up with the following file sizes:\n\n.wasm: 16kb,\n.wasm.gz: 7.3kb,\n.wasm.br: 6.2kb.\n\nNeat! Brotli is implemented by most\nbrowsers, so when the client sends\nAccept-Encoding: br, the server can response with the .wasm.br file.\nTo give you a feeling of what 6.2kb represent, the following image also\nweights 6.2kb:\n\n\n  \nAn image that is as weight as our compressed WebAssembly module.\n  \n\nThe WebAssembly binary is ready to run!\nWebAssembly ð Javascript\n\n\n\nIn this section, we assume Javascript runs in a browser. Thus, what we\nneed to do is the following:\n\nLoad/stream and instanciate the WebAssembly binary,\nWrite the blog post to parse in the WebAssembly module memory,\nCall the root function on the parser,\nRead the WebAssembly module memory to load the flat AST (a sequence\nof bytes) and decode it to build a âJavascript ASTâ (with our own\nobjects).\n\nThe entire code lands\nhere.\nIt is approximately 150 lines of code too. I won't explain the whole\ncode since some parts of it is the âfriendly APIâ that is exposed to the\nuser. So I will rather explain the major pieces.\nLoading/streaming and instanciating\nThe WebAssembly\nAPI\nexposes multiple ways to load a WebAssembly binary. The best you can use\nis the WebAssembly.instanciateStreaming\nfunction:\nIt streams the binary and compiles it in the same time, nothing is\nblocking. This API relies on the Fetch\nAPI. You\nmight have guessed it: It is asynchronous (it returns a promise).\nWebAssembly itself is not asynchronous (except if you use thread), but\nthe instanciation step is. It is possible to avoid that, but this is\ntricky, and Google Chrome has a strong limit of 4kb for the binary size\nwhich will make you give up quickly.\nTo be able to stream the WebAssembly binary, the server must send the\napplication/wasm MIME type (with the Content-Type header).\nLet's instanciate our WebAssembly:\n\nThe WebAssembly binary has been instanciated! Now we can move to the\nnext step.\nLast polish before running the parser\nRemember that the WebAssembly binary exports 3 functions: alloc,\ndealloc, and root. They can be found on the exports property,\nalong with the memory. Let's write that:\n\nGreat, everything is ready to write the runParser function!\nThe parser runner\nAs a reminder, this function has to: Write the input (the blog post to\nparse) in the WebAssembly module memory (Module.memory), to call the\nroot function (Module.root), and to read the result from the\nWebAssembly module memory. Let's do that:\n\nIn details:\n\nThe raw_input is encoded into a sequence of bytes with the\nTextEncoderAPI,\nin input,\nThe input is written into the WebAssembly memory module with\nwriteBuffer and its pointer is returned,\nThen the root function is called with the pointer to the input and\nthe length of the input as expected, and the pointer to the output is\nreturned,\nThen the output is decoded,\nAnd finally, the input is deallocated. The output of the parser will\nbe deallocated in the readNodes function because its length is\nunknown at this step.\n\nGreat! So we have 2 functions to write right now: writeBufferâ and\nreadNodes.\nWriting the data in memory\nLet's go with the first one, writeBuffer:\n\nIn details:\n\nThe length of the buffer is read in buffer_length,\nA space in memory is allocated to write the buffer,\nThen a uint8 view of the buffer is instanciated, which means that\nthe buffer will be viewed as a sequence of u8, exactly what Rust\nexpects,\nFinally the buffer is copied into the memory with a loop, that's very\nbasic, and return the pointer.\n\nNote that, unlike C strings, adding a NUL byte at the end is not\nmandatory. This is just the raw data (on the Rust side, we read it with\nslice::from_raw_parts, slice is a very simple structure).\nReading the output of the parser\nSo at this step, the input has been written in memory, and the root\nfunction has been called so it means the parser has run. It has returned\na pointer to the output (the result) and we now have to read it and\ndecode it.\nRemind that the first 4 bytes encodes the number of nodes we have to\nread. Let's go!\n\nIn details:\n\nA uint8 view of the memory is instanciatedâ¦ more precisely: A slice\nof the memory starting at start_pointer,\nThe number of nodes is read, then all nodes are read,\nAnd finally, the output of the parser is deallocated.\n\nFor the record, here is the u8s_to_u32 function, this is the exact\nopposite of u32_to_u8s:\n\nAnd I will also share the readNode function, but I won't explain the\ndetails. This is just the decoding part of the output from the parser.\n\nNote that this code is pretty simple and easy to optimise by the\nJavascript virtual machine. It is almost important to note that this is\nnot the original code. The original version is a little more optimised\nhere and there, but they are very close.\nAnd that's all! We have successfully read and decoded the output of the\nparser! We just need to write the Block and Phrase classes like\nthis:\n\nThe final output will be an array of those objects. Easy!\nWebAssembly ð NodeJS\n\n\n\nThe differences between the Javascript version and the NodeJS version\nare few:\n\nThe Fetch API does not exist in NodeJS, so the WebAssembly binary\nhas to be instanciated with a buffer directly, like this:\nWebAssembly.instantiate(fs.readFileSync(url), {}),\nThe TextEncoder and TextDecoder objects do not exist as global\nobjects, they are in util.TextEncoder and util.TextDecoder.\n\nIn order to share the code between both environments, it is possible to\nwrite the boundary layer (the Javascript code we wrote) in a .mjs\nfile, aka ECMAScript Module. It allows to write something like\nimport { Gutenberg_Post_Parser } from './gutenberg_post_parser.mjs'\nfor example (considering the whole code we wrote before is a class). On\nthe browser side, the script must be loaded\nwith&lt;script type=\"module\" src=\"â¦\" /&gt;, and on the NodeJS side, node\nmust run with the --experimental-modules flag. I can recommend you\nthis talk Please waitâ¦ loading: a tale of two loaders by Myles\nBorins\nat the JSConf EU 2018 to understand all the story about that.\nThe entire code lands\nhere.\nConclusion\nWe have seen in details how to write a real world parser in Rust, how to\ncompile it into a WebAssembly binary, and how to use it with Javascript\nand with NodeJS.\nThe parser can be used in a browser with regular Javascript code, or as\na CLI with NodeJS, or on any platforms NodeJS supports.\nThe Rust part for WebAssembly plus the Javascript part totals 313 lines\nof code. This is a tiny surface of code to review and to maintain\ncompared to writing a Javascript parser from scratch.\nAnother argument is the safety and performance. Rust is memory safe, we\nknow that. It is also performant, but is it still true for the\nWebAssembly target? The following table shows the benchmark results of\nthe actual Javascript parser for the Gutenberg project (implemented with\nPEG.js), against this project: The Rust parser as\na WebAssembly binary.\n\nDocumentJavascript parser (ms)Rust parser as a WebAssembly binary (ms)speedup\ndemo-post.html13.1670.252Ã 52\nshortcode-shortcomings.html26.7840.271Ã 98\nredesigning-chrome-desktop.html75.5000.918Ã 82\nweb-at-maximum-fps.html88.1180.901Ã 98\nearly-adopting-the-future.html201.0113.329Ã 60\npygmalian-raw-html.html311.4162.692Ã 116\nmoby-dick-parsed.html2,466.53325.14Ã 98\n\n  \nBenchmarks between Javascript parser and Rust parser as a WebAssembly binary.\n  \n\nThe WebAssembly binary is in average 86 times faster than the actual\nJavascript implementation.

This collection can be updated by inserting\nnew values, removing existing ones, or the collection can truncated, clearedâ¦\nThis collection acts as the standard Vec. However, there is a\nsubtlety: This collection is observable. It is possible for someone to\nsubscribe to this collection and to receive its updates.\nThis observability pattern is the basis of reactive programming. It applies to\nany kind of type. Actually, it can be generalised as a single Observable&lt;T&gt;\ntype. For collections though, we will see that an ObservableVector&lt;T&gt; type is\nmore efficient.\nIâve recently played a lot with this pattern as part of my work inside the\nMatrix Rust SDK, a set of Rust libraries that aim at developing robust\nMatrix clients or bridges. It is notoriously used by the next generation\nMatrix client developed by Element, namely Element&nbsp;X. The Matrix Rust SDK is\ncross-platform. Element&nbsp;X has two implementations: on iOS, iPadOS and macOS with\nSwift, and on Android with Kotlin. Both languages are using our Rust bindings\nto Swift and Kotlin. This is the story for another series (how we have\nautomated this, how we support asynchronous flows from Rust to foreign languages\netc.), but for the moment, letâs keep focus on reactive programming.\nTaking the Element X use case, the room list âwhich is the central piece of the\nappâ is fully dynamic:\n\nRooms are sorted by recency, so rooms move to the top when a new interesting\nmessage is received,\nThe list can be filtered by room properties (one can filter by group or\npeople, favourites, unreads, invitesâ¦),\nThe list is also searchable by room names.\n\nThe rooms exposed by the room list are stored in a unique observable type.\nWhy is it dynamic? Because the app continuously sync new data that update the\ninternal state: when a room gets an update from the network, the room list is\nautomatically updated. The beauty of it: we have nothing to do. Sorters and\nfilters are run automatically. Why? Spoiler: because everything is a Stream.\nThanks to the Rust async model, every part is lazy. The app never needs to ask\nfor Rust if a new update is present. It literally just waits for them.\nI believe this reactive programming approach is pretty interesting to explore.\nAnd this is precisely the goal of this series. We are going to play with\nStream a lot, with higher-order Stream a lot more, and wâ¦\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  Hold on a second! I believe this first step is a bit steep for someone who's not\nfamiliar with asynchronous code in Rust, don't you think?\nBefore digging in the implementation details you are obviously eager to share,\nmaybe we can start with examples.\n\n\nAlrighty. Fair. Before digging into the really fun bits, we need some basis.\nBaby steps with reactive programming\nEverything we are going to share with you has been implemented in a library\ncalled eyeball. To give you a good idea of what reactive\nprogramming in Rust can look like, let's create a Rust program:\n\n\nWhat do we see here? First off, observable is an observable value. Proof\nis: It is possible to subscribe to it, see subscriber. Both observable and\nsubscriber are seeing the same initial value: 7. When observable receives a\nnew value, 13, both observable and subscriber are seeing the updated value. Let's take it for a spin:\n\nTadaa. Fantastic, isn't it?\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  Iâ¦ I amâ¦ speechless? Is it really reactive programming? Where is the\nreactivity here? It seems like you've only shared a value between an owner and\na watcher. You're calling them observable and subscriber, alright, but how\nis this thing reactive? I only see synchronous code for the moment.\n\n\nHold on. You told me to start slow. You're right though: the Observable owns\nthe value. The Subscriber is able to read the value from the Observable.\nHowever, Subscriber::next returns a Future! Let's add this:\n\n\nIndeed. Almighty rustc is correct. The main function is not async. We need\nan asynchronous runtime. Let's use the smol project, I enjoy it a\nlot: it's a small, fast and well-written async runtime:\n\nNow let's modify our main function a little bit:\n\nPlease rustc, be niceâ¦\n\nHurray!\nWe can even have a bit more ergonomics by using the smol-macros\ncrate which sets up a default async runtime\nExecutor for us. It's useful in our case as we want to play\nwith something else (reactive programming), and don't want to focus on the async\nruntime itself:\n\nWe will take the opportunity to improve our program a little bit. Let's spawn a\nFuture that will continuously read new updates from the subscriber.\n\nThe little Timer::after calls are here to pretend the values are coming from\nrandom events, for the moment. Let's run it again to see if we get the same\nresult:\n\nHere we go, perfect! See, ah ha! It's async and nice now.\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  I believe I start to appreciate it. However, I foresee you might hide something\nbehind these Time::after. Am I right?\nAnd this task.await at the end makes the program to never finish. It explains\nthe need to send a SIGINT signal to the program to interrupt it,\nright?\n\n\nYou're slick. Indeed, I wanted to focus on the observable and the\nsubscriber. Because there is a subtlety here. If the Timer::after are\nremoved, only the last update will be displayed on the output by dbg!.\nAnd that's perfectly normal. The async runtime will execute all the\nObservable::set(&amp;mut observable, new_value) in a row, and then, once there\nis an await point, another task will have room to run. In this case, that's\nsubscriber.next().await.\nThe subscriber only receives the last update, and that's pretty important\nto understand. There is no buffer of all the previous updates here, no memory,\nno trace, subscriber returns the last value when it is called. Note that this\nis not always the case as we will see with ObservableVector later, but for the\nmoment, that's the case.\nAnd yes, if we want the task to get a chance to consume more updates, we need\nto tell the executor we will wait while the current other tasks are waken up. To\ndo that, we can use the smol::yield_now function:\n\nLet's see what happens:\n\nEh, see, new_value = 17 is not displayed, because the observable is\nupdated but the subscriber is suspended by the executor. But the others are\nread, good good.\nNote that we are dropping the observable. Once it's dropped, the subscriber\nwon't be able to read any value from it, so it's going to close itself, and the\ntask will end. That's why waiting on the task with task.await will terminate\nthis time. And thus, the program will finish gracefully.\nAnd that's it. That's the basis of reactive programming. Also note that\nSubscriber&lt;T&gt; implements Send and Sync if T implements Send and\nSync, i.e. if the observed type implements these traits. That's pretty useful\nactually: it is possible to send the subscriber in a different thread, and keep\nwaiting for new updates.\nAttack of the Clones\nHowever, at the beginning of this episode, we were talking about a collection.\nLet's focus on Vec.\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  Why do we focus on Vec only? Why not HashMap, HashSet, BTreeSet,\nBTreeMap, BinaryHeap, LinkedList or even VecDeque? It seems a bit\nnon-inclusive if you ask me. Are you aware there isn't only Vec in life?\n\n\nWell, the reason is simple: Vec is supported by eyeball. It's a matter of\ntime and work to support other collections, it's definitely not impossible but\nyou will see that it's not trivial neither to support all these collections for\na simple reason: Did you notice that Subscriber produces an owned T? Not a\n&amp;T, but a T. That's because\nSubscriber::next requires T: Clone. It means\nthat the observed value will be cloned every time it is broadcasted to a\nsubscriber.\nCloning a value may be expensive. Here we are manipulating usize,\nwhich is a primitive type, so it's all fine (it boils down to a memcpy).\nBut imagine an Observable&lt;Vec&lt;BigType&gt;&gt; where BigType is 512 bytes: the\nmemory impact is going to be quickly noticeable. So thâ¦\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  â¦ Excuse my interruption! You know how I love reading books. I like\ndefining myself as a bibliophile. Anyway. During my perusal of the eyeball\ndocumentation, I have found\nSubscriber::next_ref. The documentation\nsays:\n\nWait for an update and get a read lock for the updated value.\n\nand later:\n\nYou can use this method to get updates of an Observable where the inner type\ndoes not implement Clone.\n\n\n\nCan you stop cutting me off please? It's really unpleasant. And do not forget we\nare not aloneâ¦ doing sideways head movement\nYou're right though. There is Subscriber::next_ref. However, if you are such\nan assiduous reader, you may have read the end of the documentation, aren't\nyou?\n\nHowever, the Observable will be locked (not updateable) while any read guards\nare alive.\n\nBlocking the Observable might be tolerable in some cases, but it cannot be\ngeneralised to all use cases. A user is more likely to prefer next instead of\nnext_ref by default.\nBack to our Observable&lt;Vec&lt;BigType&gt;&gt; then. Imagine the collection contains a\nlot of items: cloning the entire Vec&lt;_&gt; for every update to every subscriber\nis a pretty inefficient way of programming. Remember that, as a programmer, we\nhave the responsibility to make our programs use as few resources as possible,\nso that hardwares can be used longer. The hardware is the most polluting segment\nof our digital world.\nSo. How a data structure like Vec can be cloned cheaply? We could put\nit inside an Arc right? Cloning an Atomically Reference Counted value\nis really cheap: it increases the counter by 1 atomically,\nthe inner value is untouched. Nonetheless, we have a mutation problem now.\nIf we have Observable&lt;Arc&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;&gt;, it means that the subscribers will be\nSubscriber&lt;Arc&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;&gt;. In this case, every time the observable wants to\nmutate the data, it is going toâ¦ beâ¦ impossible because an Arc is nothing\nless than a shared reference, and shared references in Rust disallow mutation by\ndefault. Using Observable::set will create a new Arc, but we cannot update\nthe value inside the Arc, except if we use a lockâ¦ Well, we are adding more\nand more complexity.\nSpes salutis1! Fortunately for us, immutable\ndata structures exist in Rust.\n\nAn immutable data structure is a data structure which can be copied and modified\nefficiently without altering the original.\n\nIt can be modified. However, as soon as it is copied (or cloned), it is still\npossible to modify the copy but the original data is not modified. That's\nextremely powerful.\nSuch structures bring many advantages, but one of them is structural sharing:\n\nIf two data structures are mostly copies of each other, most of the memory\nthey take up will be shared between them. This implies that making copies of\nan immutable data structure is cheap: it's really only a matter of copying\na pointer and increasing a reference counter, where in the case of Vec you\nhave to allocate the same amount of memory all over again and make a copy of\nevery element it contains. For immutable data structures, extra memory isn't\nallocated until you modify either the copy or the original, and then only the\nmemory needed to record the difference.\n\nWell, taking a deep breath, it sounds exactly like what we\nneed to solve our issue, isn't it? The Observable&lt;Immutable&lt;_&gt;&gt; and the\nSubscriber&lt;Immutable&lt;_&gt;&gt;s will share the same value, with the observable\nbeing able to mutate its inner value. The subscribers can modify the received\nvalue too, in an efficient way, without conflicting with the value from the\nobservable. Both values will continue to live on their side, but cloning the\nvalue is cheap.\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  Dare I ask how immutable data structures are implemented? It sounds like complex\nbeasts.\nI meanâ¦ a naive implementation sounds relatively doable but I am guessing there\nis a lot of subtleties, possible conflicts, and many memory guarantees that I am\nnot anticipating yet, right?\n\n\nOhâ¦ beati pauperes in spiritu2â¦ it\nis actually really complex. It may be a topic for another series or articles.\nFor the moment, if you interested, let me redirect you to one research paper\nthat proposes an immutable Vec: RRR Vector: A Practical General\nImmutable Sequence3. Be cool though, understanding this part is\nnot necessary at all for what we are talking now. It's a great tool we are going\nto use, no matter how it works internally.\nDo you know the other good news? We don't have to implement it by ourselves,\nbecause some nice people already did it! Enter the imbl crate. This\ncrate provides a Vector type. It can be used like a regular\nVec. (Side note: it's even smarter than a Vec because it implements smart\nhead and tail chunking4, and allocates in the stack or on the heap\ndepending on the size of the collection, similarly to the smallvec\ncrate. End of digression)\nObservable (immutable) collection\nThe imbl crate then. It provides a Vector type. eyeball\nprovides a crate for working with immutable data structures (how surprising\nhuh?): this crate is eyeball-im.\nInstead of providing an Observable&lt;T&gt; type, it provides an\nObservableVector&lt;T&gt; type which is a Vector,\nbut an observable one! Let's seeâ¦ what do we haveâ¦ scroll the\ndocumentation, hmm, interesting, scroll moreâ¦, okay, that's\ninteresting:\n\nFirst off, there is methods like append, pop_back, pop_front,\npush_back, push_front, remove, insert, set, truncate and clear.\nIt seems this collection is pretty flexible. The vocabulary is clear. They all\ntake a &amp;mut self, cool.\nThen, there is a with_capacity method, this is intriguing, add to\nnotes,\nFinally, we find our not-so-ol' friend subscribe, but this time it returns a\nVectorSubscriber&lt;T&gt;.\n\nLet's explore VectorSubscriber a bit more, would you? Scroll the\ndocument, contrary to\nSubscriber::next, there is no next method. How\nare we supposed to wait on an update?\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  Confer to the assiduous reader! If you read carefully the documentation of the\nSubscriber::next method, you will see:\n\nThis method is a convenience so you don't have to import a Stream extension\ntrait such as futures::StreamExt or tokio_stream::StreamExt.\n\n\n\nâ¦ fair enough. So Subscriber::next mimics StreamExt::next. Okay. Let's look\nat Stream first, it's from the futures\ncrate. Stream defines itself as:\n\nA stream of values produced asynchronously.\nIf Future&lt;Output = T&gt; is an asynchronous version of T, then Stream&lt;Item = T&gt; is an asynchronous version of Iterator&lt;Item = T&gt;. A stream represents\na sequence of value-producing events that occur asynchronously to the caller.\nThe trait is modeled after Future, but allows poll_next to be called even\nafter a value has been produced, yielding None once the stream has been fully\nexhausted.\n\nWe aren't going to teach everything about Stream: why this design, its\npros and consâ¦ However, wave its hand to ask you to come\ncloser, did you notice how Future::poll returns Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;,\nwhilst Stream::poll_next returns\nPoll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt;? It's really similar to Iterator::next which\nreturns Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;.\nLet's take a look at Poll&lt;T&gt; don't you mind? It's an enum with 2&nbsp;variants:\n\nReady(value) means a value is immediately ready,\nPending means no value is ready yet.\n\nThen, what Poll&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt; represents for a Stream?\n\nPoll::Ready(Some(value)) means this stream has successfully produced a\nvalue, and may produce more values on subsequent poll_next calls,\nPoll::Ready(None) means the stream has terminated (and poll_next should\nnot be called anymore),\nPoll::Pending means no value is ready yet.\n\nIt makes perfect sense. A Future produces a single value, whilst a Stream\nproduces multiple values, and Poll::Ready(None) represents the termination of\nthe stream, similarly to None to represent the termination of an Iterator.\nAhh, I love consistency.\nWe have the basis. Now let's see StreamExt. It's\na trait extending Stream to add convenient combinator methods. Amongst other\nthings, we find StreamExt::next! Ah ha!\nIt returns a Next type which implements a Future, exactly what eyeball\ndoes actually. Remember our:\n\nIt is exactly the same pattern with StreamExt::next:\n\nPieces start to come together, don't they?\nEnd of the detour. Back to eyeball_im::VectorSubscriber&lt;T&gt; . It is possible to\ntransform this type into a Stream with its\ninto_stream method. It returns\na VectorSubscriberStream. Naming is\nhard, but if I would have to guess, I would say it implementsâ¦ aâ¦ Stream?\n\nYes, it does!\nDust blown away, the puzzle starts to appear clearly. Let's back on coding!\n\n\nTime to show off:\n\nDo you see something new?\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  Hmm, indeed. With Observable, some values may âmissâ because Observable\nand Subscriber have no buffer. The subscribers only return the current value\nwhen asked for. However, with ObservableVector, things are different: no\nmissing values. There are all here. As if thereâ¦ was a buffer!\nAnd the values returned by the subscriber are not the raw T:\nwe see PushBack. It comes from, check the documentation,\nVectorDiff::PushBack!\n\n\nGood eyes, well done.\nFirst off, that's correct that PushBack comes from\nVectorDiff. Let's come back to this piece in\na second: it is the cornerstone of the entire series, it deserves a bit of\nexplanations.\nSecond, yes, VectorSubscriber returns all values! There is actually a\nbuffer. It's a bit annoying to continue with a task as we did so far, let's\nuse assert_eq! instead.\n\n\nBeautiful! Howeverâ¦ the code is a bit verbose, isn't it? Desperately waiting\nfor an affirmative answer, okay, okay, something you may not know about me:\nI love macros. There. I said it. Let's quickly craft one:\n\nThis macro does exactly what our assert_eq! was doing, except now it's shorter\nto use, and thus more pleasant. Don't believe me? See by yourself:\n\nThere we go.\nHaving a scientific and rigorous approach is important in our domain. We said\nObservableVector seems to contain a buffer, and VectorSubscriber seems to\npop values from this buffer. Let's play with that. I see two things to test:\n\nModify the ObservableVector, and subscribe to it after: Does the\nsubscriber receive the update before it was created?\nHow many values the buffer can hold?\n\n\nIf the subscriber receives a, it must fail, otherwise no error:\n\nLook Ma', no error!\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  We have learned that a VectorSubscriber is aware of the new updates that are\nmade once it exists. A VectorSubscriber is not aware of updates that happened\nbefore its creation.\nIn the example, VectorDiff::PushBack { value: 'a' } is not received before\nsubscriber was created. However, VectorDiff::PushBack { value: 'b' } is\nreceived because it happened after subscriber was created. It makes perfect\nsense.\nIt suggests that the buffer lives inside VectorSubscriber, and not inside\nObservableVector. Or maybe the buffer is shared between the observable and the\nsubscribers, with the buffer having some specific semantics, like a channel.\nWe would need to look at the implementation to be sure.\n\n\nAgree. This is left as an exercise for the reader, wink to you.\nWe have an answer to question 1. What about question 2? The size of the buffer.\n\n\nHmm, the buffer doesn't seem to be full with 16 values. Let's add a couple more:\n\n\nOh! An error, great! Our assert_next_eq! has failed. subscriber\ndoes not receive a VectorDiff::PopBack but a VectorDiff::Reset.\nLet's play with\nObservableVector::with_capacity\na moment, maybe it's related to the buffer capacity? Let's change a single line:\n\n\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  We have learned that ObservableVector::with_capacity controls the size of\nthe buffer.\nThe name could suggest that it controls the capacity of the observed Vector,\nÃ  la Vec::with_capacity, but it must not be confused.\nFor a reason we ignore so far, when the buffer is full, we receive a\nVectorDiff::Reset. We need to learn more about this type.\n\n\nObservable differences\nThe previous section was explaining how immutable data structures could save us\nby cheaply and efficiently cloning the data between the observable and its\nsubscribers. However, we see that eyeball-im, despite using imbl, does\nnot share an imbl::Vector but an eyeball_im::VectorDiff. Why such design?\nIt looks like a drama. A betrayal. An act of treachery!\nWell. Firstly, eyeball-im is relying on some immutable properties of Vector.\nAnd secondly, the reason for which VectorDiff exists is simple. If a\nsubscriber receives Vectors, how is the user able to see what has changed? The\nuser (!) would be responsible to calculate the differences between 2&nbsp;Vectors\nevery time! Not only this is costly, but it is utterly error-prone.\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  Are you suggesting that VectorSubscriber (or VectorSubscriberStream)\ncalculates the differences between the Vectors itself so that the user doesn't\nhave to?\nI still see many problems though. I believe the order of the VectorDiffs\nmatters a lot for some use cases. For example, let's consider two consecutive\nVectors:\n\n['a', 'b', 'c'] and\n['a', 'c', 'b'].\n\nHas 'b' been removed and pushed back, or 'c' been popped back and inserted?\nHow can you decide between the twos?\n\n\nWe can't âit would be implementation specifics anywayâ and we don't want to.\nThe user is manipulating the ObservableVector in a special way, and we should\nideally not change that.\nThese VectorDiff actually comes from ObservableVector itself! Let's look at\nthe implementation of\nObservableVector::push_back:\n\nEach method adding or removing values on the ObservableVector emits its own\nVectorDiff variant. No calculation, it's purely a mapping:\n\nObservableVector::â¦VectorDiff::â¦Meaning\nappend(values)Append { values }Append many values\nclear()ClearClear out all the values\ninsert(index, value)Insert { index, value }Insert a value at index&nbsp;\npop_back()PopBackRemove the value at the back\npop_front()PopFrontRemove the value at the front\npush_back(value)PushBack { value }Add value at the back\npush_front(value)PushFront { value }Add value at the front\nremove(index)Remove { index } Remove value at index\nset(index, value)Set { index, value }Replace value at index by value\ntruncate(length)Truncate { length }Truncate to length values\n\n  \nMappings of ObservableVector methods to VectorDiff variants.\n  \n\nSee, for each VectorDiff variant, there is an ObservableVector method\ntriggering it.\n\n  \n    Le Comte\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n  And what about VectorDiff::Reset?\nWe were receiving it when the buffer was full apparently. You are not mentioning\nit, and if I take a close look at ObservableVector's documentation, I don't\nsee any reset method. Is it only an internal thing?\n\n\nYou are correct. When the buffer is full, the subscriber will provide a\nVectorDiff::Reset { values } where values is the full list of values. The\ndocumentation says:\n\nThe subscriber lagged too far behind, and the next update that should have\nbeen received has already been discarded from the internal buffer.\n\nIf the subscriber didn't catch all the updates, the best thing it can do is to\nsay: Okay, I am late at the party, I've missed several things, so here is the\ncurrent state!. This is not ideal, but the subscriber is responsible to not\nlag, and this design avoids having missing values. If a subscriber receives\ntoo much VectorDiff::Resets, the user may consider increasing the capacity of\nthe ObservableVector.\nFiltering and sorting with higher-order Streams\nWe are reaching the end of this episode. And you know what? We have set all the\nparts to talk about higher-order Stream, chante victory and dance at the\nsame time!\nAt the beginning of this episode, we were saying that the Matrix Rust SDK is\nable to filter and to sort an ObservableVector representing all the rooms.\nHow? VectorSubscriberStream is a Stream. More specifically, it is a\nStream&lt;Item = VectorDiff&lt;T&gt;&gt;. Now questions:\n\nWhat's the difference between an unfiltered Vector and a filtered Vector?\nWhat's the difference between an unsorted Vector and a sorted Vector?\nWhat's the difference between a filtered Vector and a sorted Vector?\nand so on.\n\nAll of them are strictly Stream&lt;Item = VectorDiff&lt;T&gt;&gt;! However, the\nVectorDiffs aren't the same. A simple example. Let's say we build a vector by\ninserting 1, 2, 3 and 4. We subscribe to it, and we want to filter out\nall the even numbers. Instead of receiving:\n\nVectorDiff::Insert { index: 0, value: 1 },\nVectorDiff::Insert { index: 1, value: 2 },\nVectorDiff::Insert { index: 2, value: 3 },\nVectorDiff::Insert { index: 3, value: 4 }.\n\nâ¦ we want to receive:\n\nVectorDiff::Insert { index: 0, value: 1 },\nVectorDiff::Insert { index: 1, value: 3 }: note the index, it is not 2\nbut 1!\n\nWe will see how all that works in the next episodes and how powerful this design\nis, especially when it comes to cross-platform UI (user interface). We are going\nto learn so much about Stream and Future, it's going to be fun!\n1\nLatine expression meaning salvation hope.\n\n2\nLatine expression meaning bless are the poor in spirit.\n\n3\nRelaxed-Radix-Balanced\n(RRR) Vector: A Practical General Purpose Immutable\nSequence by Sticki N., Rompf T., Ureche V. and Bagwell P.
