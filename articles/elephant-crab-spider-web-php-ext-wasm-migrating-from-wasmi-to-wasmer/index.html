    <p><em>This is a copy of <a href="https://medium.com/wasmer/php-ext-wasm-migrating-from-wasmi-to-wasmer-4d1014f41c88">an article I wrote for
Wasmer</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>First as a joke, now as a real product, I started to develop
<a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/php-ext-wasm">php-ext-wasm</a>: a
<a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> extension allowing to execute
<a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> binaries.</p>
<p>The PHP virtual machine (VM) is <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/">Zend
Engine</a>. To write an extension, one
needs to develop in C or C++. The extension was simple C bindings to a
Rust library I also wrote. At that time, this Rust library was using
<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi"><code>wasmi</code></a> for the WebAssembly VM. I
knew that <code>wasmi</code> wasn’t the fastest WebAssembly VM in the game, but the
API is solid, well-tested, it compiles quickly, and is easy to hack. All
the requirements to start a project!</p>
<p>After 6 hours of development, I got something working. I was able to run
the following PHP program:</p>
<pre data-lang="php" class="language-php z-code"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="z-embedding z-php"><span class="z-text z-html z-basic"><span class="z-meta z-embedded z-block z-php"><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-embedded z-begin z-php">&lt;?php</span></span><span class="z-meta z-embedded z-block z-php"><span class="z-source z-php">

<p>The API is straightforward: create an instance (here of <code>simple.wasm</code>),
then call functions on it (here <code>sum</code> with 1 and 2 as arguments). PHP
values are transformed into WebAssembly values automatically. For the
record, here is the <code>simple.rs</code> Rust program that is compiled to a
WebAssembly binary:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>It was great! 6 hours is a relatively small number of hours to go that
far according to me.</p>
<p>However, I quickly noticed that <code>wasmi</code> is… slow. <a href="https://webassembly.org/">One of the promise of
WebAssembly</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/#assumptions-for-efficient-execution">common hardware
capabilities</a>
available on a wide range of platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And clearly, my extension wasn’t fulfilling this promise. Let’s see a
basic comparison with a benchmark.</p>
<p>I chose <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/nbody.html">the <em>n-body</em>
algorithm</a>
from <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/">the Computer Language Benchmarks
Game</a> from
Debian, mostly because it’s relatively CPU intensive. Also, the
algorithm has a simple interface: based on an integer, it returns a
floating-point number; this API doesn’t involve any advanced instance
memory API, which is perfect to test a proof-of-concept.</p>
<p>As a baseline, I’ve run the <em>n-body</em> algorithm <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/program/nbody-rust-7.html">written in
Rust</a>,
let’s call it <code>rust-baseline</code>. The same algorithm has been <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/program/nbody-php-3.html">written in
PHP</a>,
let’s call it <code>php</code>. Finally, the algorithm has been compiled from Rust
to WebAssembly, and executed with the <code>php-ext-wasm</code> extension, let’s
call that case <code>php+wasmi</code>. All results are for <code>nbody(5000000)</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rust-baseline</code>: 287ms,</li>
<li><code>php</code>: 19,761ms,</li>
<li><code>php+wasmi</code>: 67,622ms.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so… <code>php-ext-wasm</code> with <code>wasmi</code> is <strong>3.4 times slower</strong> than PHP
itself, it is pointless to use WebAssembly in such conditions!</p>
<p>It confirms my first intuition though: In our case, <code>wasmi</code> is really
great to mock something up, but it’s not fast enough for our
expectations.</p>
<h2 id="faster-faster-faster">Faster, faster, faster…</h2>
<p>I wanted to use <a href="https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift">Cranelift</a>
since the beginning. It’s a code generator, <em>à la</em>
<a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> (excuse the brutal shortcut, the goal isn’t to
explain what Cranelift is in details, but that’s a really awesome
project!). To quote the project itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cranelift is a low-level retargetable code generator. It translates a
<a href="https://cranelift.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ir.html">target-independent intermediate
representation</a>
into executable machine code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It basically means that the Cranelift API can be used to generate
executable code.</p>
<p>It’s perfect! I can replace <code>wasmi</code> by Cranelift, and boom, profit. But…
there is other ways to get even faster code execution — at the cost of a
longer code compilation though.</p>
<p>For instance, LLVM can provide a very fast code execution, almost at
native speed. Or we can generate assembly code dynamically. Well, there
is multiple ways to achieve that. What if a project could provide a
WebAssembly virtual machine with multiple backends?</p>
<h2 id="enter-wasmer">Enter Wasmer</h2>
<p>And it was at that specific time that I’ve been hired by
<a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer">Wasmer</a>. To be totally honest, I
was looking at Wasmer a few weeks before. It was a surprise and a great
opportunity for me. Well, the universe really wants this rewrite from
<code>wasmi</code> to Wasmer, right 😅?</p>
<p>Wasmer is organized as a set of Rust libraries (called crates). There is
even a <code>wasmer-runtime-c-api</code> crate which is a C and a C++ API on top of
the <code>wasmer-runtime</code> crate and the <code>wasmer-runtime-core</code> crate, i.e. it
allows running the WebAssembly virtual machine as you want, with the
backend of your choice: <em>Cranelift</em>, <em>LLVM</em>, or <em>Dynasm</em> (at the time of
writing). That’s perfect, it removes my Rust library between the PHP
extension and <code>wasmi</code>. Then <code>php-ext-wasm</code> is reduced to a PHP extension
without any Rust code, everything goes to <code>wasmer-runtime-c-api</code>. That’s
sad to remove Rust from this project, but it relies on more Rust code!</p>
<p>Counting the time to make some patches on <code>wasmer-runtime-c-api</code>, I’ve
been able to migrate <code>php-ext-wasm</code> to Wasmer in 5 days.</p>
<p>By default, <code>php-ext-wasm</code> uses Wasmer with the Cranelift backend, it
does a great balance between compilation and execution time. It is
really good. Let’s run the benchmark, with the addition of
<code>php+wasmer(cranelift)</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rust-baseline</code>: 287ms,</li>
<li><code>php</code>: 19,761ms,</li>
<li><code>php+wasmi</code>: 67,622ms,</li>
<li><code>php+wasmer(cranelift)</code>: 2,365ms 🎉.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the PHP extension provides a faster execution than PHP itself!
<code>php+wasmer(cranelift)</code> is <strong>8.6 times faster</strong> than <code>php</code> to be exact.
And it is <strong>28.6 times faster</strong> than <code>php+wasmi</code>. Can we reach the
native speed (represented by <code>rust-baseline</code> here)? It’s very likely
with LLVM. That’s for another article. I’m super happy with Cranelift
for the moment. (See <a href="https://medium.com/wasmer/benchmarking-webassembly-runtimes-18497ce0d76e">our previous blog post to learn how we benchmark
different backends in Wasmer, and other WebAssembly
runtimes</a>).</p>
<h2 id="more-optimizations">More Optimizations</h2>
<p>Wasmer provides more features, like module caching. Those features are
now included in the PHP extension. When booting the <code>nbody.wasm</code> file
(19kb), it took 4.2ms. By booting, I mean: reading the WebAssembly
binary from a file, parsing it, validating it, compiling it to
executable code and a WebAssembly module structure.</p>
<p>PHP execution model is: starts, runs, dies. Memory is freed for each
request. If one wants to use <code>php-ext-wasm</code>, you don’t really want to
pay that “<em>booting cost</em>” every time.</p>
<p>Hopefully, <code>wasmer-runtime-c-api</code> now provides a module serialization
API, which is integrated into the PHP extension itself. It saves the
“booting cost”, but it adds a “deserialization cost”. That second cost
is smaller, but still, we need to know it exists.</p>
<p>Hopefully again, Zend Engine has an API to get persistent in-memory data
between PHP executions. <code>php-ext-wasm</code> supports that API to get
persistent modules, <em>et voilà</em>.</p>
<p>Now it takes <strong>4.2ms</strong> for the first boot of <code>nbody.wasm</code> and
<strong>0.005ms</strong> for all the next boots. It’s 840 times faster!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wasmer is a young — but mature — framework to build WebAssembly runtimes
on top of. The default backend is Cranelift, and it shows its promises:
It brings a correct balance between compilation time and execution time.</p>
<p><code>wasmi</code> has been a good companion to develop a <em>Proof-Of-Concept</em>. This
library has its place in other usages though, like very short-living
WebAssembly binaries (I’m thinking of Ethereum contracts that compile to
WebAssembly for instance, which is one of the actual use cases). It’s
important to understand that no runtime is better than another, it
depends on the use case.</p>
<p>The next step is to stabilize <code>php-ext-wasm</code> to release a 1.0.0 version.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
