    <p>Recently, <a href="https://mnt.io/articles/bye-bye-liip-hello-automattic/">I joined
Automattic</a>.
This is a world-wide distributed company. The first three weeks you
incarn a Happiness Engineer. This is part of the Happiness Rotation
duty. This article explains why I loved it, and why I reckon you should
do it too.</p>
<h1 id="happiness-engineer-really">Happiness Engineer, really?</h1>
<p>Does it sound mad as a Cheshire cat? Pretentious maybe? Actually, it's
not at all.</p>
<p>As a Happiness Engineer, I had to make the support. This is part of the
Happiness Rotation: Once a year, almost everyone swaps its position to
help our users. I will go back on this later.</p>
<p>My role was to make our users happy. To achieve that, I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet our users, understand who they are, what they want to achieve,</li>
<li>Listen to and understand their issues,</li>
<li>Find a way to fix the issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="meet-the-users">Meet the users</h2>
<p>I need motivations in my job. Learning who our users are, and what they
want to achieve, is a great motivation. After these three weeks, I know
what my contributions will serve. It gives a meaning to each
contribution, to each day I wake up.</p>
<p>Especially in a distributed company on Internet, our users are
world-wide, they speak almost all the languages on Earth, they are
present on all continents. Their needs vary a lot, they use our
softwares in ways I was not able to foresee.</p>
<h2 id="listen-to-understand-and-fix-their-issues">Listen to, understand, and fix their issues</h2>
<p>When you are chatting with a “support guy”, you cannot imagine this is a
real engineer. This is not a random person filling a pre-defined vague
form somewhere where it is cheap to hire her. You will chat with someone
very competent. Someone that has no superior. Someone that has all the
tools to make you happy.</p>
<p>Personally, when I started, it was the first time I was using WordPress.
I was more novice than the user I was talking to. So how to fix it on my
end? I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask help to the right persons,</li>
<li>Therefore, meet Automatticians (people working with Automattic),</li>
<li>Discover all the interactions between them,</li>
<li>Understand the structure of the company,</li>
<li>How to ask help, how to formulate my questions, how to reformulate the
issues of the users…</li>
<li>Discover all the internal tools,</li>
<li>Therefore, learn how the softwares work internally and together,</li>
<li>Discover the giant internal and public documentations,</li>
<li>When needed, create bug reports or feature requests to the
appropriated teams,</li>
<li>Learn the culture of the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why it is called <em>Welcome to Chaos</em>. Yes, you have to learn a
lot in three weeks, but it is extremely educative. This is like a speed
training.</p>
<h2 id="happiness">Happiness</h2>
<p>I can ensure that when a user is grateful after you fixed its issue, the
term Happiness Engineer makes a lot of sense. Automattic provides a lot
of freedom to their Happiness Engineers to make people really happy,
both in term of tooling or financial.</p>
<p>This is the first time I see a company that is that much generous with
its customers.</p>
<h2 id="thanks-buddy">Thanks buddy</h2>
<p>Of course, when embracing the chaos, you are not alone. Everyone is here
to help you, and to answer your questions. After all, this is part of
<a href="https://automattic.com/creed/">the Automattic's creed</a> (<a href="https://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/">story of the
creed</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are
assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will
build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers.
<strong>I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague</strong>, and
<strong>I’ll remember the days before I knew everything</strong>. I am more
motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of
the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much
as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in
a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the
only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every
day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to everyone willing to help, a buddy was assigned to me. A
person that helps and teaches you everytime. This is very helpful. Thank
you Hannah!</p>
<h1 id="happiness-rotation">Happiness Rotation</h1>
<p>This experience is great. But after some time, you might forget it. So
as a reminder, once a year, you incarn a Happiness Engineer again. This
is part of the happiness rotation. As far as I understand, it implies
almost everyone in the company.</p>
<p>Note: Obviously, there is permanent happiness engineers.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I deeply think this approach has many advantages. Some of them are
listed above. It helps to understand the company, and more importantly
the users. The happiness rotation stresses the fact that users are
central to Automattic, probably like any companies, but not with this
care. Remember the creed: I will build our business sustainably through
passionate and loyal customers. To have passionate and loyal users, you
need to know them.</p>
<p>For me, it was a great experience. It was chaotic at first, but it is
worth it.</p>
