    <p>Hello fellow coders!</p>
<p>In this article, I would like to talk about how to implement a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">Finite-State
Machine</a> (FSM) with
the PHP type system. The example is a store product (in an e-commerce
solution for instance), something we are likely to meet once in our
lifetime. Our goal is to simply <strong>avoid impossible states and
transitions</strong>.</p>
<p>I am in deep love with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">Type
theory</a>, however I will try
to keep the formulas away from this article to focus on the code.
Moreover, you might be aware that the PHP <em>runtime</em> type system is
somewhat very permissive and “poor” (this is not a formal definition),
hopefully some tricks can help us to express nice constraints.</p>
<h2 id="the-product-fsm">The Product FSM</h2>
<p>A product in a store might have the following states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active: Can be purchased,</li>
<li>Inactive: Has been cancelled or discontinued (a discontinued product can no
longer be purchased),</li>
<li>Purchased and renewable,</li>
<li>Purchased and not renewable,</li>
<li>Purchased and cancellable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The transitions between these states can be viewed as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">Finite-State
Machine</a> (FSM).</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://mnt.io/articles/finite-state-machine-as-a-type-system-illustrated-with-a-store-product/./schema1.png" alt="First schema" /></p>
  <figcaption>
<p>We read this graph as: A product is in the state <code>A</code>. If the <code>purchase</code>
action is called, then it transitions to the state <code>B</code>. If the <code>once-off    purchase</code> action is called, then it transitions to the state <code>C</code>. From the
state <code>B</code>, if the <code>renew</code> action is called, it remains in the same state. If
the <code>cancel</code> action is called, it transitions to the <code>D</code> state. Same for the
<code>C</code> to <code>D</code> states.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our goal is to respect this FSM. Invalid actions must be impossible to
do.</p>
<h2 id="finite-state-machine-as-a-type-system">Finite-State Machine as a Type System</h2>
<p>Having a FSM is a good thing to define the states and the transitions
between them: It is formal and clear. However, it is tested at runtime,
not at compile-time, i.e. <code>if</code> statements are required to test if the
state of a product can transition into another state, or else throw an
exception, and this is decided at runtime. Note that PHP does not really
have a compile-time because it is an online compiler (learn more by
reading <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hywan/tagua-vm-a-safe-php-virtual-machine">Tagua VM, a safe PHP virtual
machine</a>,
at slide 29). Our goal is to prevent illegal/invalid states at
parse-/compile-time so that the PHP virtual machine, IDE or static
analysis tools can prove the state of a product without executing PHP
code.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Imagine that we decide to change a product to be
once-off purchasable instead of purchasable, then we can no longer renew
it. We replace an interface on this product, and boom, the IDE tells us
that the code is broken in <em>x</em> places. It <strong>detects impossible scenarios
ahead of code execution</strong>.</p>
<p>No more talking. Here is the code.</p>

</span></span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>Active</code> and <code>Inactive</code> interfaces are useful to create constraints
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product can be purchased only if it is active, and</li>
<li>A product is inactive if and only if it has been cancelled,</li>
<li>To finally conclude that an inactive product can no longer be purchased, nor
renewed, nor cancelled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, it defines the axiom (initial state) and the final states of
our FSM.</p>
<p>The <code>getProduct(): self</code> trick will make sense later. It helps to
express the following constraint: “A valid product cannot be invalid,
and vice-versa”, i.e. both interfaces cannot be implemented by the same
value.</p>

<p>The <code>SecretProduct</code> is a product that is active and purchasable. PHP
verifies that the <code>Active::getProduct</code> method is implemented, and that
the <code>Purchasable::purchase</code> method is implemented too.</p>
<p>When this latter is called, it returns an object implementing the
<code>Renewable</code> interface (which is also a cancellable active product). The
object in this context is an instance of an anonymous class implementing
the <code>Renewable</code> interface. So the <code>Active::getProduct</code>,
<code>Renewable::renew</code>, and <code>Cancellable::cancel</code> methods must be
implemented.</p>
<p>Having an anonymous class is not required at all, this is just simpler
for the example. A named class may even be better from the testing point
of view.</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The real purchase action is performed in the constructor of the anonymous
class: This is not a hard rule, this is just convenient; it can be done in the
method before returning the new instance,</li>
<li>The real renew action is performed in the <code>renew</code> method before returning
<code>$this</code> ,</li>
<li>And the real cancel action is performed in… we have to dig a little bit more
(the principle is exactly the same though):
<ul>
<li>The <code>Cancellable::cancel</code> method must return an object implementing the
<code>Inactive</code> interface.</li>
<li>It generates an instance of an anonymous class implementing the <code>Inactive</code>
interface, and the real cancel action is done in the constructor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, that's great garantees isn't it? <strong>PHP will raise fatal errors for
impossible actions or impossible states</strong>. No warnings or notices: Fatal
errors. Most of them are correctly inferred by IDE, so… follow the red
crosses in your IDE.</p>
<h2 id="restoring-a-product">Restoring a product</h2>
<p>One major thing is missing: The state of a product is stored in the
database. When loading the product, we must be able to get an instance
of a product at its previous state. To avoid repeating code, we will use
traits. Rebuilding the state of a product is “just” (it really is) a
composition of traits.</p>
<p>Note: In these examples, we are using anonymous classes and traits. It
is possible to achieve the same behavior with final named classes. Also
we are using a repository, which is convenient for this article, but not
necessarily the best solution.</p>
<h3 id="repository">Repository</h3>
<p>The following <code>ProductRepository\load</code> function is just here to give you
an idea of how it works.</p>

</span></span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>It is impossible to purchase the product 42 because it is in state <code>B</code>,
so it has already been purchased. It is impossible to cancel a product
twice.</p>
<p><strong>Same garantees apply here</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is possible to re-implement <code>SecretProduct</code> with the traits we have
defined for the <code>ProductRepository</code>, or to use named classes. I let this
as an easy wrap up exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>The real conclusion is that we have <strong>successfully implemented the
Finite-State Machine of a product with a Type System</strong>. It is impossible
to have an invalid implementation that violates the constraints, such as
an inactive renewable product. PHP detects it immediately at runtime.
Invalid actions are also impossible, such as purchasing a product twice,
or renewing a once-off purchased product. It is also detected by PHP.</p>
<p>All violations take the form of PHP fatal errors.</p>
<p>The product repository is an example of how to restore a product at a
particular state, with the help of the defined interfaces, and new small
and simple traits.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>It is possible to integrate product categories in this type system (like
bundles). It is more complex, but possible.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend these following readings:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2010/08/what-to-know-before-debating-type-systems.html">What to know before debating type systems</a>
to have an overview of different systems,</li>
<li><a href="https://sdleffler.github.io/RustTypeSystemTuringComplete/">Rust's Type System is Turing-Complete</a>
to see how powerful a type system can be,</li>
<li><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/willroth/fear-not-the-machine-of-state">Fear Not the Machine of State!</a>
to see how to integrate an FSM into an object without using a type system.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to particularly emphasize a paragraph from the first
article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what is a type? The only true definition is this: a type is a
<strong>label</strong> used by a type system to <strong>prove</strong> some property of the
<strong>program's behavior</strong>. If the type checker can assign types to the
whole program, then it succeeds in its proof; otherwise it fails and
points out why it failed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing types as labels is a very smart way of approaching them.</p>
<p>I would like to thanks <a href="https://ocramius.github.io/">Marco Pivetta</a> for
the reviews!</p>
