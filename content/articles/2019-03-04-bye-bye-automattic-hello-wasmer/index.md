Today is my first day at [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/).

It's with a lot of regrets that I leave Automattic. To be clear, I'm not
leaving because something negative happened, I'm leaving because I've
received the same job offer, 3 times in 10 days, from Wasmer, Google and
Mozilla. Namely to work with Rust or C++ to build a WebAssembly runtime.
This is an offer I can barely decline. It's an opportunity and a dream
for me. And I was lucky enough to get a choice between 3 excellent
companies!

I can only encourage you to [work with
Automattic](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/). It's definitely the
best company I've ever work with; stealing the 1st place to Mozilla.
Automattic is not only about WordPress.com and other services: It's a
way of living. The culture, the spirit, the interactions between people,
the mission, everything is *exceptional*. It has been a super great
experience.

I could write 100 pages about my team. They have all been *remarkable*
in many ways. I'm closer to them although they live at 10'000km, rather
than colleagues I met everyday in person in the past. Congrats to
[Matt](https://ma.tt/about/) for this incredible project.

Now it's time to work on [Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer).
It's a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) runtime written in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): My two current passions. It's
powerful, modular, well-designed, and it comes with great ambitions. I'm
really exciting. I work with an extraordinary team: [Syrus
Akbary](https://github.com/syrusakbary) (the author of
[Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene), a GraphQL
framework in Python), [Lachlan Sneff](https://github.com/lachlansneff)
(the author of [Nebulet](https://github.com/nebulet/nebulet), a
microkernel that implements a WebAssembly "usermode" that runs in Ring
0), [Brandon Fish](https://github.com/bjfish) (a great contributor of
[Truffleruby](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby), a high performance
implementation of Ruby with GraalVM), [Mackenzie
Clark](https://github.com/xmclark), and soon more.

My job will consist to work on the runtime of course, and also to
integrate/embed the runtime into different languages, such as PHP â€”like
I did with `[php-ext-wasm](https://github.com/Hywan/php-ext-wasm)`, more
to come on this blogâ€”. More secret projects coming. Let's turn them into
realities ðŸŽ‰!
