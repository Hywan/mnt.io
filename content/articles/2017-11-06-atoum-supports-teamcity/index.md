[atoum](http://atoum.org/) is a popular PHP test framework.
[TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) is a Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery software developed by Jetbrains.
Despites [atoum supports many industry
standards](http://atoum.org/features.html#reports) to report test
execution verdicts, TeamCity uses [its own non-standard
report](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD8/Build+Script+Interaction+with+TeamCity),
and thus atoum is not compatible with TeamCityâ€¦ until now.

The `atoum/teamcity-extension` provides TeamCity support inside atoum.
When executing tests, the reported verdicts are understandable by
TeamCity, and activate all its UI features.

## Install

If you have Composer, just run:

```sh
$ composer require atoum/teamcity-extension '~1.0'
```

From this point, you need to enable the extension in your `.atoum.php`
configuration file. The following example forces to enable the extension
for every test execution:

```php
<?php

$extension = new atoum\teamcity\extension($script);
$extension->addToRunner($runner);
```

The following example enables the extension **only within** a TeamCity
environment:

```php
<?php

$extension = new atoum\teamcity\extension($script);
$extension->addToRunnerWithinTeamCityEnvironment($runner);
```

This latter installation is recommended. That's it ðŸ™‚.

## Glance

The default CLI report looks like this:

![Default atoum CLI report](./cli.png)

The TeamCity report looks like this in your terminal (note the
`TEAMCITY_VERSION` variable as a way to emulate a TeamCity environment):

![TeamCity report inside the terminal](./cli-teamcity.png)

Which is less easy to read. However, when it comes into TeamCity UI, we
will have the following result:

![TeamCity running atoum](./teamcity.png)

We are using it at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/). Hope it is
useful for someone else!
