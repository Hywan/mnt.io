My self-assigned challenge for 2017 was to watch at least one conference
per day, for one year. That's the first time I try this challenge. Let's
dive in for a recap.

## 267 conferences

In some way, I failed the challenge because I've been able to watch only
267 conferences. With an average of 34 minutes per conference, I've
watched 9078 minutes, or 151 hours of *freely available* conferences
online. Why did I fail to watch 365 of them? Because my first kid was
1.5 years in January 2017, a new little lady came in December 2017, I
[got a new
job](http://mnt.io/2017/04/18/bye-bye-liip-hello-automattic/), I
[travelled for my
job](http://mnt.io/2017/11/26/automattic-grand-meetup-2017/), I [gave
talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymy8qAEe0kQ), I maintain
important open source projects requiring lot of time, I'm building my
own self-sufficient ecological house, the vegetable garden requires many
hours, I watch other videos, and because I'm lazy sometimes. Most of the
time, I was able to watch 2 or 3 conferences in a row.

## Where to find the resources?

All these conferences are freely available online, on YouTube, or on
Vimeo, for most of them. The channel I mostly watch are the following:

- [Rust](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYhcUwRBNscFNUKTjgPFiA),
- [Confreaks](https://www.youtube.com/user/Confreaks),
- [Devoxx](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBVCTuk6uJrN3iFV_3vurg),
- [elm-conf](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpGiN9AkczVjlpGDaBwQrQ),
- [BoostCon](https://www.youtube.com/user/BoostCon),
- [JSConf](https://www.youtube.com/user/jsconfeu),
- [LLVM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv2_41bSAa5Y_8BacJUZfjQ),
- [CppCon](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon),
- [Strange
  Loop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_QIfHvN9auy2CoOdSfMWDw).

It's very Computer Science centric as you might have noticed, and it
targets Rust, C++, Elm, LLVM, or Web technologies (JS, CSS…), but not
only, you can find Haskell or Clojure sometimes.

## My best-of list

In March 2017, more and more people were questionning me, and asked for
sharing. I then decided to start a [playlist of my “best-of”
conferences](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOkMRkzDhWGX_4YWI4ZYGbwFPqKnDRudf).
I've added 78 conferences in 2017, and 3 new conferences have been added
since then.

## Thoughts and conclusion

The challenge was sometimes easy and relaxing, or it was very hard to
understand everything especially at 2am after a long day (looking at you
CppCon). But it has been a very enjoyable way to learn a lot in a very
short period of time. Many speakers are talented, and listening to them
is a real pleasure. Some others are just… let's say unprepared, and it's
good to stop and jump onto another talk. It's also a good way to get
inspired by technologies you don't necessarily know (for instance, I'm
not a big fan of Clojure, but some projects are really inspiring, like
[Proto
REPL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buPPGxOnBnk&index=81&list=PLOkMRkzDhWGX_4YWI4ZYGbwFPqKnDRudf)).

Sometimes [I tweeted](https://twitter.com/mnt_io) about the talk I
watched, and it was quite appreciated too. I reckon because it's a fun
and an easy way to learn, especially with the help of video platforms
like Youtube.

Am I going to continue this challenge in 2018? Yes! But maybe not at
this frequency. It's now part of my routine to watch conferences many
times per week. I like it. I don't want to stop.

As a closing note, I would like to *thank* every speakers, and more
importantly, every conference organizer. You are doing an amazing job:
From the program, to the event, to the final sharing on Internet with
everyone. Most of you are volunteers. I know the work it represents. You
are producing *extremely valuable resources*. Thank you!
