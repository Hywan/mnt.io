The author of this blog is not alone. Companions are part of the adventure.

## Le Comte

{% comte() %}
My name is _Le Comte_. I enjoy being the main character of this story. I am
mostly here to learn, and to interrogate our dear author.

My resources are unlimited. I am fortunate to have a fortune with a secret
origin. If I want to understand something, I will work as hard as possible to
try to make light on it. My new caprice is these new modern things people are
calling _computers_. They seem really powerful and I want to learn everything
about them!

I often ask help to my Factotum for the dirty, and sometimes illegal tasks. I
rarely ask help to Le Procureur, we don't really appreciate his presence.

## Le Factotum

{% factotum() %}
My name is _Le Factotum_. It's a latin word, literally saying “do everything”.
I'm here to assist Le Comte in its fancies.

Even if I have an uneventful life now, Le Comte is partly aware of my smuggling
past. He says no word about it, but he knows I kept contact with old friends
across various countries and cultures. These relations are useful to Le Comte to
achieve its quests to learn everything about computers.

Fundamentally, when Le Comte wants to do something manky, he asks me the best
way to do that. And I always have a solution.

## Le Procureur

{% procureur() %}
My name is _Le Procureur_. I am the son of the Law and the Order. I know what
is legal, and what is illegal. If an information is missing, a detail, an
exactness, I know where to find the answer.

Some people believe I am irritating, but I consider myself the defenser of
discipline.
