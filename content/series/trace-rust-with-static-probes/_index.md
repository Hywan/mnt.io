[Userland Statically Defined Tracing][USDT] probes (USDT for short) is a
technique inherited from [DTrace]. It allows user to define statically tracing
probes in their own applicaiton; while they are traditionally declared in the
kernel.

USDT probes can be naturally consumed with DTrace, but also with [eBPF] (`bcc,
`bpftrace`â€¦).

In this series, we will explore how to compile and to use such user-defined
probes in a Rust application with a nice idiomatic API around them.
