    <div class="abstract">During October, my wife and I have visited the
    south of India. This post quickly shows our trip, some photos and some
    anecdotes. All photos can be seen on
    <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hywan/sets/72157648894718638/">my
    Flickr account</a>.</div>

    <h2>Backpacks and homestays</h2>

    <p>I have always travelled by camping. I don't like hotel so much, except
    for 1 or 2¬†nights, for a ‚Äúweekend escape‚Äù. With my wife, we like to travel a
    lot also, and this is one of our biggest affinity I think. We have
    travelled in most of continents: north and south of America, north and
    middle of Africa, Europe of course, but we have never visited Asia. What
    is the best place to start visiting Asia? India of course. And to be
    frank, she has decided to visit India so all I had to do was to acquiesce
    üòâ.</p>
    <p>Even if we travel in campsites, we use a car most of the time. For the
    first time, we have travelled only with backpacks, no car, no bags.
    Moreover, since campsites are not very common in India (for several reasons,
    like security and just because of cultural aspects) we have decided to visit
    homestays. Every time we have travelled in a specific country, we have spent
    time in someone's house. This is by far the best way to discover people,
    their cultures, their passions, their style of life and also to speak about
    politics, economics etc.</p>
    <p>Thus, with 4¬†bags (<tex>1¬†\times¬†35</tex>L, <tex>1¬†\times¬†60</tex>L and
    <tex>2¬†\times¬†8</tex>L), we have left our home to go to Basel airport,
    direction Duba√Ø and then Ernakulam.</p>

    <h2>Trip</h2>

    <p>Months before starting, we have sketched a ‚Äúbig tour‚Äù. Our goal was to
    avoid massive touristic tours and spots. So we have asked indian friends on
    Twitter or Facebook or even in IRL (oh!) about interesting spots. Then we
    have only booked for the first homestay. For the rest of the trip, we booked
    the next homestays 2 or 3¬†days before. It was a very nice experience. This
    way of travel offers a <strong>huge feeling of freedom</strong>. You do
    whatever you want whenever you want. And because it was the average
    touristic season, most of the homestays had at least one room available.</p>
    <p>Our plan was (and has more or less been) the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>arriving at Ernakulam (<em lang="ml">‡¥é‡¥±‡¥£‡¥æ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≥‡¥Ç</em>),</li>
      <li>first stop at Alappuzha (<em lang="ml">‡¥Ü‡¥≤‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µÅ‡¥¥</em>),</li>
      <li>second stop at Kozhikode (<em lang="ml">‡¥ï‡µã‡¥¥‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µã‡¥ü‡µç</em>),</li>
      <li>third stop at Wayanad,</li>
      <li>fourth stop at Mysore (<em lang="hi">‡≤Æ‡≥à‡≤∏‡≥Ç‡≤∞‡≥Å</em>),</li>
      <li>fifth stop at Kotagiri (<em lang="ta">‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Æø</em>),</li>
      <li>last stop at Fort Kochi before going back (<em lang="ml">‡¥´‡µã‡µº‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µç
          ‡¥ï‡µä‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥ø</em>).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This trip covers 3¬†states: Kerala (<em lang="ml">‡¥ï‡µá‡¥∞‡¥≥‡¥Ç</em>), Karnataka
    (<em lang="hi">‡≤ï‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤ü‡≤ï</em>) and Tamil Nadu (<em lang="ta">‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ</em>), and
    is about 1200km, in 18¬†days.</p>

    <h3>Camera</h3>

    <p>I have a
    <a href="http://www.juzaphoto.com/recensione.php?l=en&amp;t=nikon_d600">Nikon
    D600</a>. Even if I have several lens, I don't like to visit countries with
    a bag full of lens, which represents more money than people from the
    countries could never have. So I took only one lens: the
    <a href="http://www.juzaphoto.com/recensione.php?l=en&amp;t=nikon_24-85vr">Nikon
    AF-S 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5 G ED VR</a>. This is not the best lens I ever used,
    however the 24mm is beautiful (especially on a FF) and the price was very
    low (thanks to the refurb of Nikon USA!).</p>
    <p>All photos are handheld. No flash and no filter. The post-production has
    been very slight.</p>

    <h3>Alappuzha</h3>

    <p>Alappuzha is a very nice place. A lot of nature and a lot of water. This
    place is very calm, and hopefully for us because my wife's arm was
    damaged several days. The doctor visit was also very funny by the way üòâ.</p>
    <p>The following photo has been taken while a birds walk, at the
    sunrise.</p>

    <h3>Kozhikode</h3>

    <p>Second stop. <a href="http://harikt.com/">Hari</a> and I met on Github.
    He is a contributor of the <a href="http://auraphp.com/">Aura project</a>
    and this trip was a good opportunity to finally meet him in real life! He
    has gently welcomed us in his home, with his wife and family.</p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We didn't see a lot of places at Kozhikode but we have shared precious
    moments with this family, both in the kitchen and in the living room or even
    in the homes of other family's members. Another precious moment was during
    the ‚Äúshopping day‚Äù (we always try to bring back some gifts to our family).
    Oh, by the way, I will have a surprise for the public of my next conference,
    I have a bet to win!</p>
    <p>We have even been published in the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù newspapers!</p>

    </figure>

    <p>This is definitively a souvenir that only few people can have üòâ.</p>

    <h3>Wayanad</h3>

    <p>Next step. We left the city for nature again. We have visited an old
    temple, some spice plantations, waterfalls etc.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>As in the first stop, we have slept in a farm. This is an unrivalled
    opportunity to learn a <strong>lot</strong> about plants, spicies, fruits,
    cooking and history.</p>

    <h3>Mysore</h3>

    <p>Third stop. Mysore is big city. Do not go there for the food or for the
    cleanliness of the street. However, Mysore holds an old market and one of
    the most beautiful palace of India.</p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Unfortunately, it is not allowed to take photos inside the palace.
    Nevertheless, when the night comes, you can appreciate the palace
    illumination. And this is a <strong>real</strong> experience. My wife was
    saying all the time: ‚ÄúWe are in India, in front of an illuminated palace,
    surrounded by temples!‚Äù with a big smile on its face üòÑ.</p>

    <h3>Kotagiri</h3>

    <p>After a big city like Mysore, we enjoyed to reach Kotagiri. At 2000m with
    a temperature around 5/10¬∞C, it contrasts a lot with all the other regions
    and places we have visited. You can enjoy endless tea plantations.</p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Fort Kochi</h3>

    <p>Finally, before taking the airplane to go back, we have spent few days at
    Fort Kochi. This is definitively a touristic spot and it was quite shocking
    for us. This was the only place where we have seen strangers.</p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The last night was a cultural one. We have attended to a theater
    representation, called Kathakali. No word. Just music and moves. One thing
    to definitively see is the make-up.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>This was a quick summary of our trip in India with few photos. You can

    a job üòÑ  <code class="language-markup">&amp;lt;/bad_teasing&amp;gt;</code>.</p>
